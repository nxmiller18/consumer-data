Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 813 Ratings 813 Ratings forbearer , 09/30/2018 User-friendly app and responsive support The app was very easy to set up: A couple minutes after download to configure what data I wanted sync’d, and I was off and swimming/running. I actually spent most of my time remembering my logins for the data syncs like Strava, SmashRun, and Dropbox. :-)For me, the key feature this app enabled was pulling activity data off my AppleWatch+iPhone into a storage sync of my choice. Without it, I had to get multiple activity apps for the variety of workouts I do (e.g., Strava doesn’t track swimming). HealthFit simplifies things for me in the background, with very prompt synchronizations (feels like seconds between when I wake up my phone, to when I get notified of sync completion).When the start time of my activities uploaded to Strava didn’t look right, and I reached out to support, Stèphane was very responsive and helpful in chasing down the cause, which turned to be Strava not using time zone information. Stèphane even went out of her way to share potential solutions Strava-side. This demonstrated the developer’s dedication and passion for the success of this app! McKdaddy2 , 12/15/2017 Easy to use and responsive customer service I’ve enjoyed working out utilizing a couple of Garmin devices for about 4 years. My wife got me an Apple Watch 3 recently, which I’ve enjoyed, but was disappointed that I couldn’t see my workout data on Garmin Connect (GC) as it would not sync over automatically from my AW3 to GC. So I found myself using the Garmin devices for working out and the AW3 for the rest of my day.....not really utilizing the AW3 as much as I’d like. I read a review of HealthFit online and how it can aid in transferring files to GC in an easy manner. I reached out to the developer of HealthFit as to how I would move AW3 workouts to GC. First, she responded back soooo quickly, even though I told her in my initial message that would not be necessary. Second, she provided step-by-step, easy to follow instructions, going so far as to include some pictures to help with the instructions! So helpful! I’m a fan!This app now has me using my AW3 to its fullest potential (or at least as I want to fully use it). _ChuckG_ , 02/26/2023 Awesome!! I’m currently a fairly basic user and have used this app for nearly 3 years mostly to export my data to other places, but I’ve slowly realized this does everything I want in one place. A couple things I really like, among many, are gear tracking, being able to assign default gear to activities and the historical presentation of my data. I also appreciate the app privacy. The developer has done great work with this and continues to make it better. I’ve always thought it was worth way more than the meager purchase price, so now that it’s offered, I’ve become a Fanatical Supporter to show my appreciation and help keep this great app going. As I’ve now looked at this app closer, it really is a one-stop-shop that pulls all of my health data together to help me focus on my health/fitness and in my opinion it’s well worth the price.
