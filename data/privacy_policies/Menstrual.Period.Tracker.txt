By default, Menstrual Period Tracker keeps all your calendar entries on your device. We do not store your calendar entries on any external server. If you decide to backup your entries or to synchronize them with another device, your entries will be uploaded to your iCloud account which we have no access to. The application is also integrated with the Health App. You decide which data should be kept in the Health App and we have no access to this data.
