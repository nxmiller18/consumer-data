Privacy policies can be dense and inaccessible. Sometimes you just want your question answered quickly without having to navigate pages of text. With this document, we hope to make that easier. We tried our best to make our Privacy Policy as easy to navigate and understand as possible. If you have any questions while reading it, please don't hesitate to reach out to privacy@betterhelp.com.

For purposes of this Policy and unless otherwise specified, "data" includes information that is linked to one person or household including things like name, email address, phone numbers, device ID, Third Party identifiers, contact information, and communications with Therapists using our digital communication platform (the "Platform") to provide services ("Therapists"). Some jurisdictions might consider this to be "personal data," "personally identifiable information," or "sensitive personal data" in certain circumstances. When you use and access our app or website, you accept and agree to both the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, including that we'll share certain data with Service Providers.

To the extent any data is considered protected health information (“PHI”) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Notice of Privacy Practices (“NPP”) of our associated provider groups will apply and supersede any conflicting practices set forth in this document. The applicable NPP is located here.

In the United States, we provide two separate and distinct offerings. First, the ability to pay using your health insurance, when appropriate, if the BetterHelp providers are in-network with your health plan ("Insurance Offering").  Second, the ability to get a subscription package of services ("Subscription Offering").

If you are a member under our Insurance Offering ("Insurance Member"), the NPP applies to your PHI and, by using the Platform, you agree that you have read and accepted the NPP. This Privacy Policy will not be applicable to your PHI, which includes therapy data and other data after you login. Please refer to the NPP to understand how your PHI will be handled, your rights and how to exercise them with respect to PHI.

If you are a member of our Subscription Offering ("Subscription Member"), then this Privacy Policy is the controlling document that outlines how we may use data associated with you, and the NPP does not apply.

We may update this Privacy Policy. When we make significant changes to this Policy, we will notify you through our website or app when you log in to your account. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information.

This document is broken into seven sections divided by topic. To navigate to a section, reference the list below which provides examples of the types of questions that will be answered in that section. When you find a section that interests you, just click on it and you'll be automatically directed there.

What data we Process depends on how you're using our website, app, or the Platform and, if you are in the US, whether you are an Insurance Member or Subscription Member. We explain in the section below the specific data we Process and, in the section following this, the business purpose for collecting and Processing this data. You will also see a column that identifies the legal basis for processing the data. We may rely on one or more legal bases for processing.

As highlighted in the table below, we collect and Process “Therapy Data“, which includes health and treatment information that is required to facilitate therapy.

You can find information on how long we store the data we collect and Process these categories of data in the ""How long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?"" section of this Privacy Policy.

Legal basis for processing

If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may Process Therapist Data, Therapy Quality Data, Therapist Engagement Data, User ID, Onboarding Data, Account Registration Data to:

Profile Boost Program. The Profile Boost Program is an optional feature which shares the client-facing profile of BetterHelp Therapists with Google Search Ads and Directory partner websites, for the purpose of driving users to your profile and bringing you new clients. This Program is optional, and Therapists may opt-out at any time.

Additional information about the Profile Boost Program, and the self-serve opt-out feature, is available on the Expertise and Preferences page of your Therapist Dashboard once you sign-up.

The legal basis for processing the above data for Therapists on our Platform (or for the purposes of recruiting them) are legitimate interest, performance of a contract, and consent.

In addition to processing, we also share some data with Service Providers12 in order for us to operate the Platform and to perform necessary website and application functions. Additionally, when you opt into sharing, we share certain data with Third Parties. For more information please see the section: "What are the purposes for sharing my data?"

If you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons (previously &quot;Targeting cookies&quot;) some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy and/or PHI, may be shared for advertising purposes. To learn more, see section, "Are you using my data for advertising?".

We process your IP address to determine your rough location so that we can personalize the platform for you. For example, we show you relevant information about our service that applies to visitors from your country.

We also utilize your rough location to improve your user experience when using our platform. For example we auto populate your state (if applicable) and country when you are completing our onboarding questionnaire.

We do not request or process exact location information such as information provided by your phone via GPS.

We Process your address information when you provide it as part of your emergency contact information when you start therapy on the Platform. Your contact information is required to comply with therapy regulations and ethical code. It can be used, for example, in case your Therapist believes you are in immediate danger. When you are filing out this field, we may process your rough location to provide autocomplete suggestions for your convenience.

Rough location using your IP address is also Processed by the ReCAPTCHA security API tool we use. ReCAPTCHA is a Service Provider we use to identify potentially malicious actors trying to access our site. Here is the ReCAPTCHA Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

To learn about the additional purposes for which we Process IP addresses, please see:

We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services. Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing. The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently. For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively. We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists. To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.

Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:

For Insurance Members: If you are an Insurance Member, your PHI will only be shared for the purposes outlined in the NPP in accordance with HIPAA.

Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.

If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions. This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.

If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes. For more information about your specific settings, see here. To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?"

When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies. This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.

You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities. Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment. You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.

We aren't paid by anyone for any data. However, in California, the laws define "sale" broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value. If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a "sale" of personal information under that specific California law. For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.

In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps. In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.

Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy and PHI, may be shared for advertising purposes. As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.

If you use the App and have "Allowed" app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective. This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads. If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to "Sharing Settings" in the App and opt out of advertising. For IOS users, you can "Ask App Not to Track" when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking). From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.

Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in "retargeting" advertising. Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.

To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers. Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.

As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns. Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it  and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.

For additional information regarding Third Parties that  may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.

For Insurance Members: If you are an Insurance Member, then please refer to the NPP.

BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.

Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive or, under the Insurance Offering, you cease being an Insurance Member. These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information. Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.

In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.

The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access. In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See "What is this Privacy Policy") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.

BetterHelp's data retention policies are based upon what data is being Processed1, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity

Click that and follow the instructions to begin the data erasure process. You will receive a confirmation email from us within 24 hours of your request.

If you do not have access to your account or are having trouble with this method, you can directly contact Member Success at contact@betterhelp.com and they will assist you with the process.  Additionally, if, under applicable data protection laws, you have the right to request that data we hold about you be edited or rectified, you may make this request by contacting Member Success. You can expect to receive an email confirming receipt of your request within 24 hours.

Additionally you can visit our opt out instructions page to request erasure or to opt out of previous settings you have opted into.

You may reach out to us at DPO@betterhelp.com if you need additional help. We will only comply with a request for the erasure of your data if we can verify your identity. There is usually no charge. In exceptional circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee after discussing the fee with you.

If you reach out to either Member Success or DPO@betterhelp.com, we have specific requirements that must be met in order for us to process your data erasure request.

In some circumstances, legal or regulatory requirements limit our ability to honor erasure requests. As such, we may decline requests for erasure if the information is:

Additionally, compliance obligations require us to retain records documenting certain interactions you have with us related to your Membership. As such, we cannot honor erasure requests for information contained in records of:

If we don't intend to comply with a request, then we will tell you why this is the case, and outline how we weighed your rights and freedoms against our legal obligations. In such instances, any information retained will only be used for purposes contemplated under the legally recognized exemption.

To receive a summary copy of your data, please log in to your account and go to Menu > My Account (or Account settings) > My Personal information, where you will see an option to request a copy of your data. The data you will receive as part of this request includes the contact information that you input on the site, questionnaire answers, worksheet entries, emergency contact information, messages you sent to your Therapist, journal entries that you created, and other personal information.

Additional data which we maintain includes email interactions with our help desk, which is stored on your email system. You may also request this information by writing to DPO@betterhelp.com. As with data erasure, we are not always able to respect your request for data access. For more information on why this may be and how the situation will be handled, please reference the previous section.

Yes. We keep a limited log of the request, such as your contact details (such as your email address), the identity-verification documents you provided (if applicable), the steps we took to respond, and a copy of our response.

We retain this information for 10 years for legitimate business or legal reasons, so that we can demonstrate compliance with US and international data protection laws and legal obligations, resolve any follow-up queries you may have, and defend legal claims.

We automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization's relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed. (e.g., an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).

To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send. On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data."

Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data. As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.

We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure. Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind. Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.

BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data. We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks. We have numerous robust security practices such as:

For your own security, keep the following in mind:

When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp under the Subscription Offering, we do not ask you for your full name. You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system. You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you. You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization's email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances. When you decide to start the therapy process, we'll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger. Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.

Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet. Read more about what data we Process1 and why here:

If you're interested in further limiting what data is Processed, visit our opt-out instructions page to opt-out of tracking via cookies or web beacons, or for instructions on how to remove previously set cookies.

You and your Therapist are able to see the messages you send, the worksheets you submit. Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.

A licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes. For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist's clinical care.

In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.

Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded, unless you expressly consent. We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.

We don't knowingly collect or solicit any data or information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to become our users. The Platform is not directed at and not intended to be used by children under the age of thirteen (13). If you're aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen (13), please let us know by contacting us, and we'll delete that information.

A "cookie" is a small data file that is accessible within a folder on a computer, and it is used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are used to enhance performance of the Platform, personalize your experience and can be used for Third Party2 tracking (as described above). For example, cookies may be used to help you quickly log into certain platforms and websites without having to enter your credentials every time.

A "web beacon" or "pixel" is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a web page or email that can report your visit or use to a Third Party (as described above). In general, these tools can be used to monitor the activity of users for the purpose of web analytics, advertising optimization, or page tagging.

We use our own cookies and web beacons to deliver a faster and safer experience, to monitor and analyze usage, to comply with laws, and for advertising purposes. To read more about the kinds cookies we use and their purposes, to update your settings, or to opt out, click here.

Other California privacy rights

California's “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to Third Parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to DPO@betterhelp.com.

This section provides additional information about our Policy relevant to you if you are from the European Economic Area (the EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together “European Area Countries”). It supplements and should be read in conjunction with the rest of the Policy. Under the European Area Countries' privacy laws, we are the Controller with respect to your data.

What are my rights and choices under European Area Countries laws?

European Area Country residents have specific rights regarding their data. This section describes your rights if you are resident in the European Area Countries and explains how to exercise those rights.

To exercise the rights in relation to your data set out in this section, please contact us at DPO@betterhelp.com.

Is my data transferred internationally?

We transfer data from the EU to the U.S because our servers are located in the US. This transfer is conducted on a legal basis to ensure the protection of your data and compliance with applicable data protection laws. The legal basis for this transfer is the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which has been recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data transferred to participating US companies. Our company is certified under this framework, ensuring that your personal data is subject to rigorous protection standards when transferred to and processed in the US. To learn more about the DPF click here.

Additionally, we may transfer your data to organizations based in countries that have not been granted an adequacy decision under the General Data Protection Regulation. Where data is transferred to such countries, we shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are used to do that (such as by using standard contractual clauses with those vendors) or specific derogations have been established (for example where the data transfer is necessary in order to fulfill a contract between us and yourself, where we have received your specific consent after having made you aware of any risks involved, etc).

You can contact our Data Protection Officer with questions, about this Policy, or about your data by writing to:

While we'll always work with you to resolve any concerns you have about the use of your data, under GDPR you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country of residence if you have any concerns about our use of your personal information.

Additional Privacy Notice for non-US, non-UK, and non-EU residents

As a part of our standard business practices, data is transferred outside of many visitors' countries of residence and predominantly used, accessed and processed within the U.S. Fortunately, given the robust and rigorous nature of privacy laws in the US, UK, and EU with which we comply, BetterHelp considers that this has the effect of protecting user information in a way that, overall, is at least substantially similar or in many ways exceeds non-US data privacy legal requirements. BetterHelp is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF) which has been recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data transferred to participating US companies. To learn more about the DPF click here. To the extent we contract with vendors who are outside of the U.S, we ensure that specific safeguards have been established to protect that data.

BetterHelp complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("EU-U.S. DPF"), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("Swiss-U.S. DPF") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively "the Data Privacy Framework").

BetterHelp has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union, and the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) and to the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/

If you are located in the EU, UK or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the Personal Data that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles. We will give you an opportunity to opt out where Personal Data we control about you is to be disclosed to an independent third party or used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us via the details provided below.

In compliance with the DPF Principles, BetterHelp commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any DPF Principles-related complaints within 45 days. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Data received in reliance on the DPF Principles should first contact BetterHelp at DPO@betterhelp.com

BetterHelp is also subject to the enforcement, and sanctioning powers of the FTC and will comply with the applicable Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) in regard to BetterHelp's processing of personal data that we receive from the EU, or UK, and Switzerland.

In the context of an onward transfer, BetterHelp is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. BetterHelp shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless BetterHelp is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

For example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we're able to respond to you and provide an answer.

Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization's account, answer questions, and provide support.
