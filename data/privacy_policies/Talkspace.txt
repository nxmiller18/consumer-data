Talkspace (“we”, “our”, “us”, “Talkspace”) takes your privacy seriously, and we want you to know how we collect, use, share and protect your information.

Talkspace Therapy Services

Talkspace offers therapy services using our proprietary technology platform, which leverages advanced data-driven tools to personalize your care and to enhance evidence of care, care continuity, outcomes metrics and data-based learnings. We provide mental health professionals with insights and capabilities to drive improved and measurable clinical outcomes for patients receiving virtual therapeutic services on our platform.  

When you enroll, inquire about enrolling for, or use Talkspace Services (as defined below), we keep a record of medical information that you provide to us or your therapist as well as any medical information that Talkspace employees or independently contracted therapists provide to you via our platform (such as information on and related to your diagnosis). Medical information means any information that:

This includes medical history, diagnoses, treatments, current medical condition, and use of prescription medications. If you are a US subscriber to Talkspace services, your personal data in our possession is protected health information ("PHI") protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), and the applicable provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act. In addition to this Privacy Policy, the HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices of Talkspace or your Talkspace Provider apply to your PHI.

Peer Support Services

We may offer opportunities to participate in moderated peer support forums, such as Teenspace Community (“Peer Support Services”).  Peer Support Services are not a substitute for therapy and when you participate you acknowledge and agree that Peer Support Services do not provide you with therapy or other healthcare-related services.  When you submit a post or comment using the Peer Support Services, other users will be able to see the contents of the post or comment, the username associated with the post or comment, the date and time you originally submitted the post or comment, your state of residence, and your age.  Your post or comment may be re-posted or re-shared by other users (online or offline) even if you restrict access to the post or comment.  You can remove posts, comments, or other information associated with your use of Peer Support Services at any time using your account settings.  You can also use our block feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.  Never use the Peer Support Services to publicly share your personal data, including your real name, email address, phone number, address, or other contact details.

Collected automatically when you use the Services

Service Providers:  We may disclose the information we collect from and about you, including each category of your personal data identified in this Policy, to our service providers to perform a business, commercial, technical, advertising, marketing, analytics, or other support function for us, to help us operate our business, to administer activities on our behalf, or as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.

Partners:  We may disclose information described under “Persistent Identifiers” in the above Personal Data Processing chart, to our business partners and third parties, such as data analytics providers, advertising technology vendors, third-party advertising networks, and social media platforms, for purposes of providing personalized advertising, marketing, and analytics-related services.

Legal Compliance and Corporate Transactions:  Talkspace may be required to disclose your personal data (a) to government and law enforcement authorities to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests, (b) to certain third parties such as an acquiring entity or advisers in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceeding), or (c) where we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to (i) comply with applicable law, (ii) enforce our terms and conditions; (iii) protect our operations; (iv) protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or those of you or others; and (v) allow us to pursue available remedies or limit damages that we may sustain.

The Talkspace App includes third party software development kits (SDKs) from a number of other companies whom we engage as service providers, for identifying and logging code issues, errors and events; managing interactive communication within the App; compiling analytics on which features get used the most; facilitating customer service contacts regarding subscriptions and service; and processing device identifiers and event logs for ad attribution purposes (such as the initial login event, account creation, subscription events). These third parties process data as a service to Talkspace only, pursuant to written agreements. Talkspace does not sell client information to third parties.

The Talkspace therapy experience is enhanced by advanced data processing activities, carried out in order to measure and improve clinical outcomes. Our proprietary matching algorithm and machine-learning tools provide real-time engagement insights, inform treatment, and track clinical progress, and are fundamental to our precision therapy care delivery model. 

Matching Algorithm. During onboarding we ask you to provide information so that we can assess your condition and incorporate your preferences. We then leverage a proprietary algorithm (and/or support from a Talkspace consultant) to match you to a provider. 

Optimizing Diagnosis and Treatment. Throughout your experience, your provider uses the Talkspace Services to manage your diagnosis and treatment plan. The advanced machine learning features of our proprietary Services include natural language processing of communications with therapists. A core focus of our machine learning strategy is to provide the therapist with insights on patient needs and behaviours and offer techniques and suggestions that we believe are likely to maximize clinical outcomes. We also use advanced machine learning features to generate therapy notes where requested by our therapists.

Separate and apart from internal healthcare operations and quality assurance activities undertaken for the purpose of delivering and optimizing patient care on the platform, from time to time, Talkspace conducts or participates in research studies with select universities. You may be offered the opportunity to participate in these studies. If your protected health information will be disclosed as part of these studies, your information will only be included with your written authorization. You will be asked to review and accept terms and enrollment separately from the information included in this Policy. Information from these studies may be published by third parties including through various media platforms/academic journals. See our Notice of Privacy Practices.

When you create a Talkspace account or otherwise use the Talkspace Services, we collect (or you may provide us with) your email address, and you have the choice to receive newsletters or promotional material about our services at this address. These messages may be tailored to your responses to onboarding surveys so that you receive information relevant to you. You can further manage your email preferences by unsubscribing from emails (via the link in the message), emailing [email protected] or by visiting our online preference center within the App or the Website. ‍
