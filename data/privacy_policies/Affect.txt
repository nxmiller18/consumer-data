(“Affect” or “Affect Therapeutics”) collects, uses, and stores your information that we gather when you interact with us, including when you use the Services or the Affect App. By using the Services or the Affect App, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. In the course of your accessing or using the Services or the Affect App you may interact with healthcare providers (including a Provider) using Affect Therapeutics’ platform. Please note that this Privacy Policy describes how we protect your privacy as a general user of the Services (including the Affect App) and not any information collected from you on behalf of Providers that is protected health information (“PHI”) governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). Where PHI is collected from you on behalf of your Providers, our HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices will govern our collection and use of such protected health information, not this Privacy Policy. We also may use aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Once de-identified and aggregated so that data does not personally identify you, it is no longer personal information. Such de-identified or aggregated information which does not identify individuals is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we may use or disclose it in our discretion. We do not share your information with third parties, except as set forth below. All of the categories of information described in Section 2 above may be shared as described below. If you do not want the Affect App or the Services to collect information through the use of cookies and similar data collection technologies, your browser may allow you to manage and reject the use of cookies. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn more about changing cookie settings. If you reject or block cookies, you may lose some of the functionality or features of the Affect App or certain Services. Some web browsers have a “do-not-track” feature that informs websites with which the browser communicates to not track the user’s online activity. The Affect App does not currently respond to these “do-not-track” signals or similar mechanisms.
