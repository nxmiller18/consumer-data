This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect, how we use and share Personal Data, and your choices concerning our Personal Data practices. We employ a number of technical, organisational and physical safeguards that are designed to protect the Personal Data we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data. Please read this Privacy Policy before using our Service or submitting any Personal Data to AllTrails and contact us if you have any questions.
Information We Collect
When you contact us or interact with our Service, we collect information about you (including that which otherwise constitutes ‘personal data’ or similarly defined term under applicable laws) (“Personal Data”) as follows:
* Personal Data You Provide to Us: We collect Personal Data when you sign up for our Service via the Site or an AllTrails App. The Personal Data collected during these interactions may vary based on what you choose to share with us, but it may include any of the following:
   * Account Data: When you sign up, some information is required to create an account on our Service, such as your name and email address.
   * Payment Data: If you choose to purchase a subscription to our Service via credit card, debit card or other payment method, our third-party payments processors (Stripe or PayPal) will collect and process certain payment and billing information, such as billing postcode, payment card details and authentication features, on behalf of AllTrails. That information is collected by our payment processors directly, and we do not collect or store it. If you have any questions about how our payment processors protect such information, please read Stripe’s services agreement and privacy policy as well as PayPal’s services agreement and privacy policy.
   * Social Media Data: We have pages (“Social Media Pages”) on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn (each a “Social Media Site”). The platforms that host our Social Media Pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics regarding the use of our Social Media Pages. Additionally, should you choose to interact with any of our Social Media Pages, we may collect Personal Data that you provide or make available via our Social Media Pages.
   * User-Generated Content: User-generated content, such as photos, images, videos, community posts, reviews, community comments, and other content or information that you generate, transmit or otherwise make available on the Service, as well as associated metadata. Metadata includes information about how, when, where and by whom a piece of content was collected and how that content has been formatted or edited. Metadata also includes information that users can add or can have added to their content, such as keywords, geographical or location information, and other similar data.
   * Contacts Book Data: Our mobile applications may allow you to synchronise the numbers in your Contacts address book on a regular basis in order to identify any friends and/or relatives who use the Service. If any of your contacts are using the Service, we will let you know so that you can connect with them. You can revoke our access to your Contacts address book at any time via your mobile device settings.
   * Additional Information: To customise your experience or enable certain features of the Service, you may choose to provide us with additional information, such as your date of birth, height, weight, profile picture, location (city) and favourite activities. 
   * Sensitive Personal Data: In the course of using the Service on our App, you may choose to allow us to collect sensitive Personal Data about you, such as your precise geolocation, by turning on location services on your mobile device, which may be considered ‘sensitive personal information’ (or a similarly defined term) under certain applicable laws. Turning on location services on your mobile device constitutes consent for us to collect your precise geolocation. You can disallow our collection of precise geolocation data by turning off location services on your mobile device at any time. You may also choose to share other sensitive Personal Data via the content you share on our Site, for example, when leaving a review, or otherwise sharing information on our Site. By sharing this information, you consent to the collection of this sensitive Personal Data. You may limit the visibility of such sensitive Personal Data via our Privacy Settings; refer to our FAQs here for further information. We do not process sensitive Personal Data for purposes other than providing the Services.
* Personal Data We Generate From Your Use of Our Service: When you visit, use, interact and register with the Service, we may automatically generate certain information about your visit, use, interactions or registration. For example, we may monitor the number of people that visit our Site or AllTrails Apps, peak hours of visits, which page(s) are visited on our Site or AllTrails Apps, the domains our visitors come from (e.g. google.com, yahoo.com, etc.) and which browsers people use to access and visit our Site (e.g. Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.), broad geographical information, and Site- and AllTrails App-navigation pattern. In particular, the following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:
   * Log Data: Information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit the Site or AllTrails Apps. Log data includes your IP address (so we understand which country you are connecting from when you visit the Site or AllTrails Apps), browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you interacted with the Site or AllTrails Apps.
   * Cookies Data: We use cookies and similar technologies to operate and administer our Site and AllTrails Apps, make it easier for you to use the Site and AllTrails Apps during future visits, and gather usage data on our Site and AllTrails Apps. For more information about the technologies used and information collected on our Site and AllTrails Apps, please refer to our Cookie Policy, which forms part of this Privacy Policy.
   * Device Data: Includes the model of the device, operating system, and browser you are using. Information collected may depend on the type of device you use and its settings. We may also collect data from your device to estimate a variety of metrics like the time, frequency and duration of, and calories burned during, your activities for the purpose of calculating your Usage and Activity Data (described below).
   * Usage and Activity Data: We collect information about how you use our Site and AllTrails Apps, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, and the time, frequency and duration of, and calories burned during, your activities.
   * Geolocation Data: If you have enabled location services for an AllTrails App on your mobile device or on your computer via the Site, we may collect your geolocation information based on IP address, city, county, postcode, country, latitude and longitude. AllTrails may also derive your approximate location from the IP address of your computer or mobile device. Geolocation data is used for purposes of directing you to nearby trails and parks and offering other relevant content and services. We do not process Geolocation Data unless you grant permission through your device or browser.
   * Inferences about You. We may combine the information we collect and otherwise generate or draw inferences about your preferences and interests in order to provide and personalise our Service to you, such as trail suggestions and estimated calories burned during activities.

While we do not sell Personal Data for money, like many companies, we use services that help deliver targeted ads to you as described above. Applicable state privacy laws may classify our use of some of these services as ‘selling’ or ‘sharing’ your Personal Data with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can submit requests to opt out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes using GPC opt-out preference signals (as described above) by clicking the ‘Manage Cookies’ link at the bottom of our homepage or by contacting privacy@alltrails.com.
                                                      * Verification of identity. Once we receive your request, we will require you to verify your identity in order to process your request. To verify your identity, we require you to respond to an email that we send to the email address associated with your AllTrails account. We require identity verification through email authentication before privacy requests can be processed as we require only limited information in order to create an account and, as a result, it is difficult to verify your identity even if we collect additional information. If we are unable to verify your identity through email authentication, we will be unable to complete your request.
Under some state privacy laws, you may enable an authorised agent to make a request on your behalf. However, we may need to verify your authorised agent’s identity and authority to act on your behalf. We may require a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorised agent pursuant to applicable law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorised, such as by providing your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your state privacy law rights on your behalf, the information we request to verify your identity and confirmation that you have given the authorised agent permission to submit the request.

                                                         * Right to erasure: You may ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data, such as where you withdraw your consent. If we shared your data with others, we will tell them about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data with so you can contact them directly.
                                                         * Right to restrict processing: You may ask us to restrict or ‘block’ the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it (please read below for information on your right to object).

If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so you can contact them directly.
                                                         * Right to data portability: You have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data from us, to the extent that it is processed by automated means. We will give you a copy of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You may reuse it elsewhere.
                                                         * Right to object: You may ask us to stop processing your Personal Data, and we will do so:
                                                         * If we are relying on a Legitimate Interest to process your Personal Data, unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or we need to process your Personal Data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                                                         * If we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing, we may keep minimum information about you in a suppression list in order to ensure that your choices are respected in the future and to comply with data protection laws.

Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
To confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data, you will need to verify your identity through email authentication. If you are unable to authenticate your email address, we may be unable to complete your request. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
If you would like to exercise any or all of these rights, you may do so by clicking ‘Make a Privacy Request’ or contacting privacy@alltrails.com. If you have shared Personal Data with us via our Social Media Pages, you may contact the Social Media Site regarding the rights you may have under their applicable privacy policies and terms.

•
Inferences: We may make inferences based on the information we collect.


Third-Party Health Information


With your permission, our Services connect to third-party applications and services (the “Third-Party Applications”), which may include Apple Health, laboratory and testing services and other providers for whom you offer us permission to connect our Services. We connect to these Third-Party Applications solely for the purpose of importing certain health information about you. Such health information may include the following: heart rate, sleep information, movement and exercise activity, blood oxygen levels, respiratory rate, height, weight and age. If you permit our Services to access certain laboratory and testing services, then imported health information may include your results from such services, for example, blood test results. The health information you permit us to access in connection with the Services is collectively referred to as “Health Information.” See “Where Your Information Is Stored” below for information regarding where your Health Information is stored.


How We Collect Your Personal Information


We collect personal information from the following sources:


•
Directly. We collect personal information directly from you. When you register for the Services, submit information in an online form, request information from us, or otherwise communicate with us or our support personnel, you may provide us with information, for example, your name and email address.  We also collect Health Information about you by importing information from the Third-Party Applications (see above). By providing us with this information or allowing us access to the Third-Party Applications, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, processed and stored by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


•
From Third-Party Applications. We may collect Health Information about you by importing information from Third-Party Applications, if you permit us to do so. Imported Health Information is generally stored and processed on your device, except where you opt in to features (such as Bevel Intelligence) that require cloud processing. By providing us with this information or allowing us access to the Third-Party Applications, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, processed, and stored by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


Where Your Information Is Stored


•
Personal information and user-generated data. Contact information (such as name, email, phone, and profile data) and non-biometric user-generated data (such as logged workouts, diet, and activity history) are stored using secure third-party cloud hosting providers so that this information can sync across devices and support your use of the Services.


•
Health Information. Imported biometric Health Information (such as heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen, and respiratory rate) is, by default, stored and processed locally on your device. Unless you enable Bevel Intelligence, we do not store or access such imported biometric Health Information in the ordinary course of providing the Services.


•
Bevel Intelligence. If you enable the optional Bevel Intelligence feature, certain biometric Health Information (excluding reproductive health information unless you expressly opt in) may be transmitted through third-party cloud hosting and artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology providers in order to generate AI-powered responses and coaching. Only the minimum relevant information necessary to generate a response will be transmitted. Once such data is processed through those third-party providers, it is subject to their systems and safeguards.


To provide the Services, we store and process your personal data in the United States, where the Company is based. By using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand and consent to having any personal information transferred to and processed in the United States. If you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), we will transfer your personal information pursuant to EU data protection laws. You understand that the United States may not provide the same level of protections as the laws in your country. United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances law enforcement or regulatory agencies, courts or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.

Restrictions. We do not use Health Information for advertising or marketing purposes.

Bevel Intelligence & Third-Party Artificial Intelligence Technology


When enabled, Bevel Intelligence processes Health Information you authorize us to access, including biometric information from Third-Party Applications. By default, reproductive health information is not transmitted to Bevel Intelligence; you may separately opt in if you wish the feature to use that data. Bevel Intelligence is a generative AI feature that is intended to help you understand and make progress to your goals, provide educational guidance, and integrate with the rest of your experience using our Services. To provide this feature, we leverage third-party cloud hosting providers and AI technology from our large language model partners. Your Health Information will be transmitted to, and processed by, these third parties solely for the purpose of generating responses and guidance.


We take the following steps to protect your privacy:


•
We only share Health Information in a format intended to minimize direct identifiability.


•
We may retain the history of your conversations with Bevel Intelligence so you can review past exchanges and so the feature can provide continuity and context in future interactions. Certain data used to generate conversations, which may include biometric or other sensitive information, may be retained for up to thirty (30) days for debugging and quality assurance purposes and is then deleted from our servers. After that period, only the conversation history itself remains available to you, unless you request its deletion. To access your information or request deletion, please contact us at hello@bevel.health.


Please note that Bevel Intelligence generates responses based on your inputs and Health Information, and those responses may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent. Bevel Intelligence does not provide medical advice and should never be relied upon as a substitute for professional medical care, diagnosis, or treatment. You should always consult a qualified physician or other licensed healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding your health, medical conditions, or wellness decisions.


We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information

Information for European Economic Area Residents


If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of your personal information. The term “personal information” has the meaning given to it by the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). When we process your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, we will only do so when we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our legitimate interests (for example, our legitimate interest in providing the Services, responding to your inquiries, or sending you marketing communications) or the legitimate interest of others but will depend on the type of personal data and the specific context in which we process it.


Additionally, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal data, including:


•
Access. You can request more information about the personal data we hold about you and request a copy of such personal data.


•
Rectification. If you believe that any personal data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data. You can also correct some of this information directly by logging into your account.


•
Erasure. You can request that we erase your personal data from our systems.


•
Withdrawal of consent. If we are processing your personal data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your personal data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.


•
Portability. You can ask for a copy of your personal data in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.


•
Objection. You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your personal data for certain purposes.


•
Restriction of processing. You can ask us to restrict further processing of your personal data.


•
Right to file a complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal data with the supervisory authority in the relevant EEA member state, UK or Switzerland, as applicable, where you reside. For contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please see: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index\_en.htm.


•
Obtain a copy of any Standard Contractual Clauses or other international data transfer agreement we may use to transfer your personal data outside of Europe.


For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email hello@bevel.health. Please note that in some circumstances, we may be allowed to wholly or partially decline your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws (including the GDPR), but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision in accordance with the timescales under such laws. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include personal data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.


Usage and Deletion of Personal Information


You may request what personal information we have collected, used and disclosed about you as well as the identity of the third parties to which we have disclosed your personal information. You may also request deletion of your personal information. Please note that we may not delete all of your information if: (1) we need it to complete a service as requested by you or perform under a contract we have with you; (2) we need such information to repair any errors to our Services or detect data security violations; or (3) we need such information to protect against fraud or illegal activity or to comply with applicable law. Please note that if we delete your personal information, we may not be able to provide you the Services with the same functionality.


To make any request for personal information or deletion, please send an email to hello@bevel.health.

Information Collected Automatically
When you interact with the Services, we and third parties may collect information about your browser, device, and use of the Services, including but not limited to your IP address, device type and model, operating system, unique device identifier, cookie identifiers, other device or online identifiers, browser type, language, frequency of use of the Services, web logs, crash reporting, Site pages visited, and navigation through those pages. We may also collect technical information when you interact with emails or other communications from us (e.g., whether you opened an email). Some of this information is collected using cookies or other similar technologies. For more information, see the ""Your Rights and Choices"" section below.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may collect information about you from our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries.
We may also collect information about your interactions with Blueprint on third-party platforms, including our social media accounts. This information includes, but is not limited to, your likes and shares of our content.
If you log into the Services using your social media credentials, we may collect information about you from the social media site based on the authorizations and permissions set with the social media site. Logging into the Services through social media credentials is optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect.
We store some information that we receive from social media sites with other information that we collect about you. The social media site controls the information that it collects from you. For information about how the social media site may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult its privacy policy. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.
If you choose to connect the Services to third-party platforms or tools, or with other apps on your device (e.g., health or fitness monitoring platforms or tools, or your contacts, photos, or calendar), such third parties and tools may allow us to have access to and store additional information as it relates to your use of the Services (e.g., to integrate your fitness data within the Services). If you do not wish to have this information disclosed, do not initiate these connections.
Please note that the App may collect certain information when it is not open on your device. For example, if you have integrated the App with a fitness app, and that fitness app records a workout, the App will collect this workout data even if the App is not open at the time the data is generated.

We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services. We may use and disclose appropriately aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose.
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds they rely on to process your information.

Many of the rights described above are subject to limitations or exceptions under applicable law.

We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to your request, including by asking you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify you.
In some cases (e.g., if you are an EEA or UK resident), you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country of residence, but we encourage you to contact us first, as we would like to do our best to resolve any concern you may have.
Marketing Communications
You may use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of emails we send to you to opt out of receiving future marketing emails. If you are currently receiving SMS/text messages from us and wish to opt out of receiving such messages, you may do so by replying STOP. You can also notify us of your desire to opt out of marketing via phone calls or direct mail using the information in the ""Contact Us"" section below. We process requests to be placed on do-not-mail, do-not-phone, and do-not-contact lists as required by applicable law.
Note that if you opt out of marketing communications, you may continue to receive certain non-promotional communications about services you request or engage with (e.g., a confirmation of purchase email) and service-related communications regarding us and our Services and opting out of marketing communications will not halt those communications (e.g., communications regarding our Services or updates to our legal terms, including this Policy).
Cookies
We and third parties use cookies and other similar technologies (such as web beacons and pixels) to collect information about your use of our Services. Cookies are files that are stored on your device through your web browser. Web beacons and pixels, which we may place on our Services and in our emails, operate in your browser or in your email program and can run operations on your device (such as reading and writing cookies) and can send information from your device to us or third parties. Cookies and similar technologies perform a variety of functions, including enabling the Services to function, securing the Services, personalizing the Services, helping us analyze and understand use of the Services, and assisting with advertising and marketing.
You can disable cookies through your browser or device settings. Please consult your browser ""Help"" menu and device settings for more information. Certain cookies (""essential"" or ""strictly necessary"" cookies) may not be disabled as they are essential for the Services to function. If you disable cookies using a browser or device setting, that setting will apply only to the browser or device you are using, so you will need to reset the setting on a different browser or device. If you disable some or all cookies, the Services may not function as intended and some features may be unavailable.
Online Analytics
We and our vendors may use third-party analytics services on the Services to help us understand how users engage with the Services, including Google Analytics. These parties may use cookies and other technologies to help collect, analyze, and provide us with reports and/or data. For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please visit: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
Tailored Advertising
We and third parties may use the information we collect to tailor the advertising you see online. You have choices about how information about you is used for this purpose.
Some tailored advertising is carried out using cookies and similar technologies.
For Services offered via an Internet browser, you may be able to set your browser to refuse certain types of cookies or alert you when they are being used, as explained above. In addition, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (""DAA"") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of tailored advertising and your choices regarding having information used by companies participating in the DAA. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (""NAI"") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of tailored advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members. We make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of these opt-out mechanisms.
For Services offered via mobile devices, including our App, mobile devices often include settings to help you manage how your device collects and discloses information for advertising purposes. For more information on how to manage those devices settings, please visit the NAI's mobile choice page. You may also visit the DAA's AppChoices page for information about the DAA's AppChoices tool. We make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of these opt-out mechanisms.
Modifying your browser or device settings or opting out of tailored advertising via your browser or device may have different results depending on the type of device or web browser you use and the version of your device operating system. Opting out of tailored advertising does not prevent you from seeing ads online; instead, the ads you see are less likely to be customized to your interests. Opting out is generally effective only on a device-by-device, or browser-by-browser basis. If you use more than one browser or device, the effect of any opt-out mechanism may be limited to the device on which you used the mechanism.
""Do Not Track""
Do Not Track (""DNT"") is a setting that users can enable in certain web browsers. DNT signals do not have a commonly agreed-upon meaning and we do not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals.
Security
Although we take certain measures to protect your information, no method of security is perfect. By using our Services, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information, and that you provide information to us at your own risk. You are responsible for keeping your username and password confidential.
Data Retention
We may retain your information until we determine that retention no longer is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and retained, and as required by applicable law. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of information and the context and purpose of its collection and use.
Third-Party Links and Content
The Services may have links and embedded content to third-party websites, apps, or other digital properties that may have privacy policies that differ from ours. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties or their sites, apps, or properties. You should check their privacy policies to understand how they may handle your information.
Likewise, the Services may have third-party content. We do not make any representations concerning the accuracy of such information and are not responsible in any way for third-party content on our Services. You interact with third-party content at your own risk.

If we become aware that a child has disclosed information to us in a way that is prohibited by applicable children's privacy laws, we will delete such information in accordance with applicable law.
California ""Shine the Light"" Disclosure
The California ""Shine the Light"" law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes within the meaning of that law.

If you are located outside of the United States, you should be aware that any personal data you provide to us is transmitted to us and processed in the United States.

You can generally control what information they share with us by using their privacy settings.
Use across our services
We may combine information we collect from you with information obtained from third parties and information derived from any other subscription, product or service we provide.
How We Use Information
Perigee uses the information we collect to operate and improve Cycles as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use past and current menstrual cycles information and average lengths to forecast future dates for when your periods will start.
We store your health and sensitive data to your Account to offer the functionality of connecting with your partner, syncing your data across your devices and maintaining a backup of your data in case you lose or change your device. We process related symptoms and other events to give personalized insights and statistics for you.
We use your usage information to analyze and improve Cycles. To accomplish this Perigee may use third party providers to analyze and gain insight into how Cycles is used and to help us improve Cycles.
We may use your email address to send you service and marketing related notices if you have agreed to receive such messages. Those emails can be unsubscribed from with clear and simple instructions in the email. We may also use your email address to notify you on updates to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use.
We use your device information to send you notifications about events that occur in Cycles. You can always control what notifications you receive from Cycles from the Settings section in the applications. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. Perigee will use your information to communicate with you, for example by sending you notifications.
How Information Is Shared
We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as common symptoms during different phases of the menstrual cycle, average cycle lengths etc.
To analyze, gain insight and improve Cycles we might share de-identified information with third-parties. These third parties will only receive the information needed to perform these specific actions, and Perigee will never share more information than necessary.
Service Providers
We may share your information with third parties who provide services to Perigee such as supporting and improving Cycles or promoting Cycles. These service providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information.
We may also engage service providers to collect information about your use of Cycles over time on our behalf so that we or they may promote Cycles or display information that may be relevant to your interests in Cycles or other websites or services.
Legal Requirements
Our primary legal duty is under European law, and have no duty to disclose private health data to US authorities. Because we're governed under European law you can rest assured that an order by a U.S. court or any other third party outside of the EU is not a legal basis for a transfer of personal data.

We may disclose your information in response to European subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
How We Protect Information
We work hard to keep your data safe in Cycles from the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect. We use a combination of technical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using industry standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt many of our services and ensure that information is transmitted and stored securely in Cycles. In addition to this, we protect this information using advanced firewall technology.
Although we use a combination of industry standards to maintain the security of your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and Perigee cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Perigee. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.
To protect data on your device we recommend all our users to use a complex passcode, TouchID or FaceID to unlock the device Cycles is installed on. In addition to activating the device lock you can set an app specific lock on Cycles from the the applications settings. Both a 4-pin code, TouchID and FaceID is available to protect your app from unauthorised access, even if someone has access to your device.
Your Rights
Cycles provides options in the Settings to access and control your personal information. If you need any further assistance regarding your rights, feel free to contact us either from the applications or through the contact form at http://perigee.se/support.
Notifications and Email Preferences
You can stop receiving certain notifications by toggling off the reminder in the Reminders section in Cycles. You may also unsubscribe by following the clear instructions contained at the bottom of each email. Administrative or service-related emails (to confirm a purchase, updates to Privacy Policy, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services you requested.
Access Your Data
If you do not have an account then no personal information will be stored outside the device being used. By logging in to your account, you can access much of your information.
You also have the option to download your personal data we have on you when logged in to your Cycles Account.
Editing and Deleting Your data
From Cycles you can always edit your information such as name, password etc. You can also edit or delete specific recorded events like period start dates, physical symptoms, cravings etc.
You may delete your account directly from Cycles. Once deleted, all your data, including account, menstrual cycles, body symptoms, moods, events etc. cannot be reinstated.
Objecting to Data Use
In Cycles you can control our data use. For example you can delete your Account to only keep all your data locally on device. By using the reminders settings you can limit the notifications which you receive from Cycles, and you can revoke access from Apple Health through the health settings which prevents Cycles from accessing or sharing your health information with Apple Health.
Your consent for processing health and sensitive data
If you create an account with Cycles, your personal data-including sensitive data and data related to your health-is stored on your device and is also stored and processed on our servers. This is done so we can offer you backups of your data and to enable additional features such as connecting with your partner and using Cycles on multiple devices.
By creating an account with Cycles you explicitly consent that:
1. Cycles may store and process personal data you provide through the usage of the Cycles app and through the account creation process solely for the purpose of providing Cycles to you and to improve Cycle's services. Such services may include sending you information and reminders through the Cycles app or to the email address you provided for your account.
2. Personal data you provide to Cycles through the account creation process includes personal data you enter into the Cycles app, such as your account data (e.g. your name and email address), and your cycle data (e.g. period length, pain, or spotting). Depending on the data you provide, it may also contain information about your general health (e.g. body temperature, and if you engage in sexual intercourse).
3. Cycles will not transmit any of your personal data to third parties, except if it is required to provide the Cycles service to you (e.g. technical service providers), unless Cycles has asked for your explicit consent.
You may withdraw your consent to this use of your data at any time by deleting your Cycles account. If you choose to do so, you may continue using the Cycles app without an account, but since a copy of your data will no longer be stored on our servers, please be sure to make regular backups of your data to avoid data loss-we are not able to retrieve lost data of users without Cycles accounts.
Data Retention
We keep information as long as it is necessary to operate Cycles. We keep all of your information until you either delete your account or if your account has been inactive after 3 years of no activity in Cycles, whichever happens first. Following the deletion of your account, it may take up to 60 days to fully delete your personal information from our systems.
Additionally, we may retain information from deleted accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the Terms of Use or take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information about you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our services may be de-identified and aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights which are commercially valuable to Perigee, such as statistics of the use of Cycles.
Children
If you are under the age 16 you are not allowed to create an account or submit any personal data through Cycles. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet use and to help us enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide any personal data through Cycles.
If you become aware that a child under the age of 16 has submitted personal data to us, please contact us at contact@perigee.se.
If we learn that we have accessed and stored personal information about a child under the minimum required age, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
Changes to This Policy
Perigee has the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it occasionally. We will notify you before we make any substantial changes to this Privacy Policy and give you an opportunity to review the revised policy.
Any and all material changes shall come into effect between you and Perigee upon your acceptance of such changes (e.g. by using Cycles after such notification has been made to you or renewing your subscription).
If you object to any change in the Privacy Policy you should immediately delete your account and stop using Cycles.

Logging into the Services through social media credentials is optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect.
We store some information that we receive from social media sites with other information that we collect about you. The social media site controls the information that it collects from you. For information about how the social media site may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult its privacy policy.

If you choose to connect the Services to third-party platforms or tools, or with other apps on your device (e.g., health or fitness monitoring platforms or tools, or your contacts, photos, or calendar), such third parties and tools may allow us to have access to and store additional information as it relates to your use of the Services (e.g., to integrate your fitness data within the Services). If you do not wish to have this information disclosed, do not initiate these connections.
Please note that the App may collect certain information when it is not open on your device. For example, if you have integrated the App with a fitness app, and that fitness app records a workout, the App will collect this workout data even if the App is not open at the time the data is generated.

Cookies
We and third parties use cookies and other similar technologies (such as web beacons and pixels) to collect information about your use of our Services. Cookies are files that are stored on your device through your web browser. Web beacons and pixels, which we may place on our Services and in our emails, operate in your browser or in your email program and can run operations on your device (such as reading and writing cookies) and can send information from your device to us or third parties. Cookies and similar technologies perform a variety of functions, including enabling the Services to function, securing the Services, personalizing the Services, helping us analyze and understand use of the Services, and assisting with advertising and marketing.
You can disable cookies through your browser or device settings. Please consult your browser ""Help"" menu and device settings for more information. Certain cookies (""essential"" or ""strictly necessary"" cookies) may not be disabled as they are essential for the Services to function. If you disable cookies using a browser or device setting, that setting will apply only to the browser or device you are using, so you will need to reset the setting on a different browser or device. If you disable some or all cookies, the Services may not function as intended and some features may be unavailable.
Online Analytics
We and our vendors may use third-party analytics services on the Services to help us understand how users engage with the Services, including Google Analytics. These parties may use cookies and other technologies to help collect, analyze, and provide us with reports and/or data. For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please visit: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
Tailored Advertising
We and third parties may use the information we collect to tailor the advertising you see online. You have choices about how information about you is used for this purpose.
Some tailored advertising is carried out using cookies and similar technologies.
For Services offered via an Internet browser, you may be able to set your browser to refuse certain types of cookies or alert you when they are being used, as explained above. In addition, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (""DAA"") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of tailored advertising and your choices regarding having information used by companies participating in the DAA. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (""NAI"") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of tailored advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members.

We make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of these opt-out mechanisms.
Modifying your browser or device settings or opting out of tailored advertising via your browser or device may have different results depending on the type of device or web browser you use and the version of your device operating system. Opting out of tailored advertising does not prevent you from seeing ads online; instead, the ads you see are less likely to be customized to your interests. Opting out is generally effective only on a device-by-device, or browser-by-browser basis. If you use more than one browser or device, the effect of any opt-out mechanism may be limited to the device on which you used the mechanism.
""Do Not Track""
Do Not Track (""DNT"") is a setting that users can enable in certain web browsers. DNT signals do not have a commonly agreed-upon meaning and we do not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals.
Security
Although we take certain measures to protect your information, no method of security is perfect. By using our Services, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information, and that you provide information to us at your own risk.

The Services may have links and embedded content to third-party websites, apps, or other digital properties that may have privacy policies that differ from ours.

Such information may be used to send you targeted advertisements for products and services that are relevant to your interests. In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, such as aggregating your data with other data they hold in order to inform advertising related services provided to other clients. These third parties may place a Cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest.

State privacy rights notice
Certain states in the U.S., including, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia provide (now or in the future) their state residents with rights related to their Personal Information. Consistent with these laws, Although some of these rights apply generally, certain rights will only apply to limited individuals or circumstances. California residents should view the “California privacy rights notice” for information about their rights. To the extent that these laws apply, you may exercise the following rights:
Right to Know and Access. Note that much of the information you are entitled to know or access is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. With this said, you have the right to know about our information practices. You also have the right to access the categories of data we collect, with whom we share or sell that information, and, in some cases, what specific Personal Information we associate with you or your account.
Data Portability. If you request a copy of your specific Personal Information, then we will provide it in an easily accessible format.
Deletion. You may request that we delete the Personal Information we have collected about you. Depending on the applicable law, in some cases we are required or permitted to retain your Personal Information, even if you validly requested we delete or erase it.
Correction. You may request we correct or rectify inaccurate Personal Information we have collected about you.
Right to Opt out of Targeting Advertising, Sales, or Profiling. You may opt-out of our use of your Personal Information for targeted advertising, sales, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. Please note that we do not use Personal Information collected about you for automated profiling at this time. We are not making automated decisions about you. We may use profiling in regard to your Personal Information required to operate some of our services, for example, to the extent needed to predict health-related effects that you may experience from one month to the other, but currently for no other purposes. 
While traditionally we think of a “sale” to be an exchange of a product for money, data protection laws define this much more broadly. Many U.S. states specifically define a ‘sale” of Personal Information as an exchange of Personal Information with a third party for monetary or any other valuable consideration. Our use of cookies and other website tracking technologies may be considered a sale or sharing of Personal Information under applicable law, in which case the categories of Personal Information that we have sold or shared include identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) and internet or other similar network activity. Categories of third parties to whom Personal Information is sold or shared under the CPRA include data analytics providers and advertising and marketing providers.
We do not sell or share health information from our users.
You may submit these requests by email to privacy@glowing.com or at https://support.glowing.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360002386093.
For requests submitted by email, you must provide enough Personal Information that allows us to verify your identity. Only you or your authorized agent may make requests regarding your Personal Information. An authorized agent must have documentation that they are authorized to act on your behalf. We will fulfill or reject your request within the amount of time required by law.
Appeal. If we deny your rights request, you have the right to request an appeal of our decision. To initiate an appeal, follow the instructions provided in the communication denying your request, or contact us at the Personal Information provided in this Privacy Policy. 
Non-Discrimination. You have the right to not experience discrimination from us for exercising the rights listed in this section. What we mean by discrimination is denying you access to our Services or limiting the quality of our Services. However, limiting use of, or deleting, your Personal Information may restrict the purposes or uses that rely on that Personal Information.
California privacy rights notice
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in our capacity as a “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this section, “Personal Information” has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA. In some cases we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section. 
The following California Notice at Collection (including the section on Privacy Rights following the chart below) and this Privacy Policy govern the Personal Information we collect from California residents (“you”) on any website or mobile application on which a link to this notice appears and any Personal Information we collect in connection with delivering services to you, whether online or offline.

"manual_privacy_policies/Klara.txt","Klara","Klara Privacy Policy Last updated: January 14, 2025 IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES, OUR WEBSITE, OR OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS. 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. At Klara, our mission is to transform healthcare communication, so every patient can receive great care. As such, privacy is very important to us, and we strive to be transparent in our collection and use of your information. 1.2. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what information Klara Technologies Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Klara”) may collect from or about you, how we collect it, how we use it, who we share it with, and your choices related to your information. 1.3. When we use terms like “Klara”, “we”, “our”, or “us”, we are talking about Klara Technologies Inc. and its affiliates. Also, when we talk about the “Services”, we are talking about all of our products and services, such as our websites (“Sites”), mobile applications (“Apps”), our reminder and other text messages services, provider collaboration portals, and patient communication tools. 1.4. For certain information provided to us through some of Services, we have entered into agreements with our clients (health care providers or their firms, “Providers”) that govern our use of such information (the “Transaction Documents”). This Privacy Policy supplements the Transaction Documents. To be clear, if you are a patient of a Provider, a visitor to one of our Sites, or otherwise accessing or interacting with any of the Services but are not doing so as a customer of ours under a Transaction Document, you are a user but not a customer of the Services (i.e., not a Provider), and some of the terms of this Privacy Policy won’t apply to you. Additionally, if you are a patient of a Provider, this Privacy Policy does not govern our use of Protected Health Information (as defined below) provided to us through the Services, including through patient use of the Klara App and web portal. Our use of such information is governed by the Transaction Documents with your Provider and applicable law, including without limitation HIPAA (as defined below). Your Provider’s collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of such information is governed, in turn, by your Provider’s terms and conditions and privacy practices between you and your Provider. Please submit all requests and questions related to your Protected Health Information directly to your Provider. 1.5. By using the Services, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any contractual rights or obligations. Your use of the Services is governed by these Terms of Use. 2. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT When you access and use the Services, we may collect the following types of information from you: 2.1. “Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you or that relates to you. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address, email address, IP address, device information, telephone number, employer, medical specialty, profession, biometric information such as your voice print and recordings, provider profile photo, financial information, practice and business information, and other information you provide. Personal Information includes Location Information and may include Usage Data. In this Privacy Policy, we do not include Protected Health Information in the definition of “Personal Information” because, as mentioned above, Protected Health Information has different treatment under HIPAA and other applicable laws. Accordingly, it is handled differently under the Transaction Documents and, if you are a patient, your Protected Health Information is subject to your Provider’s terms of service and privacy practices. Page 2 of 7 2.2. “Location Information” is a type of Personal Information that can be used to locate the device you use to access the Services. Location Information includes (i) the location of the device derived from GPS or Wi-Fi use, (ii) the IP address of the device or internet service used to access the Services, and (iii) any other information you or others make available that indicates your current or prior location. 2.3. “Usage Data” is information that we automatically collect about your use of the Services and your device, such as your IP address; your device’s MAC address, web browser, operating system, device model and manufacturer; performance issues; or your activity on the Services. Usage Data is generally not Personal Information, but may be in some instances. 2.4. “Protected Health Information” is individually identifiable health information that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”). See the definition of Personal Information above for more information on the treatment of Protected Health Information. 3. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION 3.1. We collect the information you give to us, such as when you: 3.1.1. Contact us (e.g., to request a demo or support), 3.1.2. Register with, apply for, access, or use the Services, including when you submit information on the Services or create a Provider profile, 3.1.3. Visit our offices, 3.1.4. Apply for employment, or 3.1.5. Register for or attend webinars, conferences, or other events. 3.2. We automatically collect some information when you use the Services, such as Usage Data and when you enable the location services on your device when using the Services. If you do not want us to collect Location Information from your device, please disable the location setting(s) on your device or, if you are using an App, delete the App. Please note that disabling the location setting on your device may affect certain features of the Services. 3.3. With your consent, we may collect information from certain native applications on your device (such as your device’s camera, photo album, or microphone) to facilitate your use of certain features of the Services. For example, if you decide to upload a Provider profile photo through the App, we may access your photo album to obtain that photo. You have the opportunity to grant or deny the App access to your photo album and other native applications. 3.4. We may also obtain information about you from other sources, including the Internet and other publiclyavailable sources and databases, data aggregators, marketing companies, and other third parties. For example, if you are on a third-party website and request information from us, that website will send us your contact information. We may combine this information with the information you give us to help us tailor our communications or improve the Services. 3.5. You are not required to provide us with any Personal Information that we request from you. However, failure to provide such information may limit what we are able to do for you. For example, refusing to provide your email address may prevent us from providing you with important information about our Services. 4. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION 4.1. We may use your information for the following purposes: 4.1.1. Provide You the Services and Fulfill Your Requests.

A web beacon (also referred to as clear gif, pixel tag or single-pixel gif) is a transparent graphic image used in tandem with cookies that enables us, our vendors, and our other business partners to record a user’s actions. We use web beacons to count and track users who have visited those pages, verify system and server integrity, for advertising, and for other statistical measures. 5.1.3. User Experience and Support Products. We use third-party products that track user experiences using the Services. We use these products to improve the Services and to provide support for the Services. 5.1.4. Google Analytics.

You can set your Internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, to receive notice when you receive a new cookie, to disable existing cookies, or to omit images (which will disable any pixel tags that may be included in them).

Many websites and applications, including the Services, do not respond to web browser DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, please visit allaboutdnt.com. If you are a web visitor accessing our Sites from California, we honor Global Privacy Control signals. 6. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION 6.1.

As noted above, some features of our Apps may require access to certain native applications on your mobile device, such as the camera and photo storage applications (e.g., to take and upload photos and videos). If you decide to use these features, your device will prompt for your permission to grant the App access to the native application and enable us to collect information. Note that you can revoke your consent to the App’s access to your camera, photos, and other applications by changing the settings on your device. 7.5. Depending on your device settings, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device or within our Apps. 7.6.

By using the microphone or other recording feature, you acknowledge that you have been advised of, and understand that, the Provider’s practice, Klara, and their agents and contractors may collect, use, store, and disclose biometric data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise described in the Services. Page 6 of 7 8.2. The Provider’s practice and Klara may use the voiceprint in your recordings to transcribe text for a patient’s medical record, to improve the microphone feature, and for other product improvement and development purposes of your practice and Klara. Klara will retain and destroy, as applicable, your biometric data in accordance with our policies. Your practice’s retention and destruction of your biometric data is governed by the terms of service and privacy notices between you and the relevant Provider’s practice. 9. U.S. STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS If you are an eligible resident of California, Colorado, Delaware, New Jersey, or Oregon, please see our U.S. State Privacy Law Supplemental Notice for more information on your rights. The U.S. State Privacy Law Supplemental Notice supplements, but doesn’t replace, this Privacy Policy. 10. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION We prohibit users under 13 from using the Services. As such, we do not expect to collect information, including personal information as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us, you may contact us at privacy@klara.com to request that we delete and stop use of that information. If we learn that we have received any information directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he or she cannot use the Services. We will then subsequently delete that child’s information. 11. LINKS TO OTHER SITES The Services may contain links to other sites and other products and services that are not owned or controlled by us, including Providers’ practice websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to, be embedded on, or otherwise accessible from or on our other Services.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each and every third-party website (including Providers’ websites) that collects Personal information as their privacy policy may differ from ours. 12. PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION The security of Personal Information is important to us. We use reasonable safeguards aimed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the Personal Information we collect and maintain. Although we strive to protect your Personal Information, we can’t guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from the Services or that unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction or some other data breach will not occur. Please keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. 13.

Full Notice Regarding Information in Your Medical Record

Our Pledge Regarding Your Medical Record
Your health care treatment is personal to you and we understand the importance of protecting your Medical Record. This Notice applies to all Medical Records we create, control, or maintain, and outlines the ways your information in those records are used or disclosed, and what your choices are.
What is a Medical Record
Please note, your Medical Record contains only a limited set of Personal Information that relates to the health care we provide to you. For example, it may include demographic information, diagnosis, or communications with a provider.

To understand how all your Personal Information is handled by Lemonaid Health, please review our Privacy Policy. To the extent there are any conflicts between the Privacy Policy and this Notice related to your Medical Record, this Notice will govern.

In some circumstances, your Medical Record could have additional information about your health that we give special consideration to protecting. Examples of this information include, but are not limited to, psychotherapy or mental health notes, results related to sexually transmitted infection(s) (""STI""), or genetic information. We require additional authorization from you before we use or disclose that information.
How We Use and Disclose Your Medical Record
The following categories describe ways that we may use or disclose your Medical Record.
? For Treatment. We disclose your Medical Record in the course of providing medical treatment or in coordinating or managing any Services you've received or requested. For example, we may disclose your Medical Record with members of our Medical Team involved in your care to provide an additional consult or to fill a prescription.
? For Providing Services. We may use and disclose your Medical Record to carry out our business operations and be able to provide the Services to you. These uses or disclosures are related to things like billing or fulfilling prescriptions, quality of care, compliance activities, administrative purposes, contractual obligations, grievances, or legal obligations. For example, we may use information in your Medical Record to review the treatment and services provided or to evaluate the performance of the staff and contractors caring for you.
? To Comply with Your Instructions. We will disclose your Medical Record as directed by you. For example, if you choose to disclose your Medical Records with a third party available on the Services, we will do so with your consent.
? As Required by Law. We will disclose your Medical Record when required to do so by federal, state, or local law. In certain circumstances, Lemonaid Health may be required by law to comply with a valid court order, subpoena, or search warrant for a Medical Record. As permitted under applicable law, we will provide notice to you prior to sharing your Medical Record.
? Disclosure for Threats to Health and Safety. In certain circumstances, we are required to disclose your Medical Record to help protect you or someone else's health and/or safety. For example, we may ask local law enforcement to perform a health and welfare check if, in our provider's professional judgment, a welfare check is necessary.
? Public Health Reporting Requirements. We are required to report certain test results, like STI or positive COVID tests, to health agencies for public health purposes.
Special Considerations
In certain situations, some sensitive information in your Medical Record will not be used or disclosed without your written authorization, unless required by law. Some examples of types of information that need specific authorization:
? Genetic Information. This is any information about your individual genotype, including results of any genetic test.
? Psychotherapy Notes. We do not create psychotherapy notes in your Medical Record since mental health counseling is not a part of our medical team's depression and anxiety care.
? STI Test Results. This is information related to any sexually transmitted infection(s) you experience. For more information on what we are required to report, please see the FAQ.
? HIV/AIDS Results. This is information related to any HIV or AIDS test results.
Control of Your Medical Record
You have control over your Medical Record. You can request the following by contacting the Health Care Compliance Team at the address below.
? Copy of your Medical Record. With certain exceptions, you may receive copies of your Medical Record, which may include information such as your diagnosis, provider notes, and treatment plan.
? Correction. If you believe that information in your Medical Record is incorrect or incomplete, you may ask us to correct the information.
? List of Disclosures. You may request a list of certain third parties we have disclosed your Medical Record with in the past 12 months.
? Request Us to Limit How We Use or Disclose Your Medical Record. You can request that we limit how we disclose your Medical Record with your family members or others involved in your care. If you provide any written authorization to disclose your Medical Record, you are free to revoke your authorization at any time in writing. After receiving the request, we will stop any further use or sharing of your Medical Record, except in cases where we have already acted based on your previous permission. We are unable to undo any disclosure already made with your permission.
? Request Confidential Communications. You can request that we communicate with you about your appointments or other health care matters in a specific way. We'll do our best to accommodate your reasonable request but may be unable to if it causes significant operational or administrative burdens.
? Account Deletion: As mentioned in our Privacy Policy, you are free to delete your account at any time. We may retain all or part of your Medical Record after you close your account for a limited period of time as required by law, contractual obligations, as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, audit and/or compliance purposes.
In some circumstances, we may not be able to accommodate your request if it conflicts with our legal obligations, the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or it affects our ability to provide the Services.

Our use of your personal data
Your privacy is important to us, and we will only process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and relevant personal data regulation.

? First and last name
? E-mail

? Country of residence
? Weight
? Height

? Technical information related to your use of your device which could be attributed to you (i.e. geo-location data, access history, search history, and information regarding your interaction with the application or advertisements) which is used to provide the Services and to allow Lifesum to market to you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
As you continue to use the Services, you will regularly provide Lifesum with further personal data. It follows from the nature of the Services that we must process such data that you upload to the Services to enable the Services, for example, we will process your weight data and calorie intake to enable the monitoring and presentation of your personal goals (whether it be weight loss or weight gain). This processing is a prerequisite for us being able to offer the Services to you.
If you connect to the Services using a Third-Party Application for authentication e.g. Facebook Login or Google Auth, Lifesum will collect and use your personal information from such Third Party Applications such as your username, name, profile picture, country, hometown, email address, date of birth, and gender. Similarly, if you connect your Lifesum account with a Third Party Application for tracking your nutrition, exercise, hydration, sleep, or step count data, e.g., Apple HealthKit, Google Health Connect, Fitbit, Withings, Oura, Runkeeper or Garmin, Lifesum may share or process such data with said Third Party Application to provide the requested integration.

For some of the data mentioned above, collected from you and processed by Lifesum for certain features of the Services, it may be possible for us to delete and cease processing for the future if you so require, without your having to terminate your use of the entire Services, i.e., not all data (submitted over time by you to us either directly or through third-party services) is required for you to still be able to use the Services. If you want us to cease processing certain data about you under this category, we will inform you about the consequences of such cessation. Specifically, we will inform you how any deletion of your data will affect your use of the features of the Services.
Customer relationship as a legal ground
It should be noted that marketing sent by Lifesum to you on the basis of a customer relationship as a legal ground for processing personal data does not require a consent. Such data will be processed and used in compliance with relevant personal data regulation. Note that you may have a right to object to processing under this legal basis depending on the jurisdiction you live in.
Profiling
Lifesum's Services are based on a profound knowledge of best practice with regard to health. Lifesum cooperates with nutritionists, behavioral psychologists, personal trainers, and stress experts to stay on top of the latest research and science. In addition, Lifesum analyzes the usage of the Services in order to provide you as a user with the most relevant features of the Services as possible with regard to your personal goals. In analyzing the usage of the Services, Lifesum will process certain data for so-called profiling. Profiling means processing of your and other users' personal data to analyze or predict aspects of your use of the Services, behavior, and location in reaching your health goal. The data processed will be user habits where we will track actions taken by you, such as when you move between screens, press buttons, and take actions on the Services. The purpose of the profiling is to monitor how engaged users are in different features of our Services, find out ways to make the Service more effective (fit for purpose). and vary the features or content to better match your individual usage patterns and preferences.
The profiling of your data can also be used as the basis for marketing towards other new potential customers on platforms other than the Lifesum Services, such as other social media platforms. Please note that this so-called look-alike process of recruiting new customers does not mean that you will receive any marketing. Nor does it mean that any other third parties will gain access to your data for any other purpose than for Lifesum to reach new customers, i.e. third party providers (for example social media) will only process your data on behalf of Lifesum as processors. See further under ""Transfer of data"" below.
Lifesum's processing of your personal data for profiling purposes as described above does not require any consent as a legal ground to be processed. If this should be the case, i.e. if, under relevant personal data regulation, consent is required for the use as described above, you hereby give your consent to Lifesum to use your personal data as defined above for profiling, for the purpose of improving the Services, and for providing customer support.
Direct marketing
Lifesum may use your personal data for profiling and direct marketing purposes via emails, notifications, or other messages, by Lifesum or Lifesum's selected business partners. Profiling will be used for marketing purposes to enable personalized and relevant offers to you, based on your preferences, see more above under Profiling.
The use of personal data for direct marketing purposes will only concern such offers that have a close relation to your use of the Service and the offers will be sent to you by Lifesum; no personal data will be transferred to third parties for direct marketing purposes. This processing is based on a legitimate interest, on our side the interest to offer you the best possible service, on your side the possibility to be offered relevant products and services relevant to your use of the Service and for third parties to reach you with such offers.
Opt-out from direct marketing
In case you do not want Lifesum to use your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, you may at any time unsubscribe from any further messages by clicking the ""unsubscribe"" link at the bottom of such a message, or by using such opt-out features as are available in the app settings in the Services.

You should further limit access to your computer and browser and log out after having used the Lifesum Services.
California Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of the State of California, the California Civil Code provides you with some additional rights beyond those specified above. California's Civil Code section 1798.100, et seq.provides residents of California the ""right to know,"" the ""right to delete,"" and the ""right to opt-out.""
Right to Know
You may request that Lifesum provide you the specific pieces of personal information that Lifesum has about you, categories of personal information we have collected about you, categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, categories of personal information that Lifesum sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you, categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information. Please note that much of the information you can make a request for is already contained in this Privacy Policy.
Should you wish to exercise this right, please see the section below which explains how to do so. If you do not have an account with Lifesum, we may ask for some personal information in order to verify your identity and your rights to the data subject to your request. This is because Lifesum is prohibited from disclosing specific pieces of personal information pursuant to a request under this section if we have not verified that the individual requesting the information is the individual to whom the information relates. As a consequence, we will match your identifying and authenticating information you provide as part of your request to the information we have in our databases to make sure we provide only you with your information.
Right to Delete
California law gives residents a limited right to request deletion of their personal information. However, this right is limited by a number of exceptions. Fundamentally, if Lifesum has a permissible need to retain personal information, we are not under an obligation to delete such information, even when requested. Generally, we retain personal information so we may complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected; provide a good or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between us and you; detect security incidents; protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for that activity; debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended unctionality of our online properties; enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with Lifesum; comply with a legal obligation; or otherwise use your personal information internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which you provided the information. As such, we generally do not accept requests to delete personal information. However, we will respond to requests to remove personal information from some of our systems as part of a request to close or otherwise disable a membership account. If you would like to request deletion of personal information, please see the section below which explains how to do so. If you do not have an account with Lifesum, we may ask for some personal information in order to verify your identity and your rights to the data subject to your request.
Right to Opt-Out of Sale
Lifesum does not sell your Personal Information to third parties, and as such, there is no need for you to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Designating an Authorized Agent
California law permits California residents to designate an agent to manage their rights under California law. If you would like to designate an agent to manage your privacy preferences, you may do so using the mechanisms noted below under ""Exercising California Privacy Rights."" Note that If you do not have an account with Lifesum, we may ask for some personal information in order to verify your identity and your rights to the data subject to your request. We will also need sufficient personal information about your authorized agent to be able to identify them. As part of this process, you must have permission from your authorized agent to disclose their personal information to us for the purpose of acting as your agent.
Non-discrimination
California law does not permit Lifesum to discriminate against you because you exercised any your rights under this title, including, but not limited to, by denying you access to goods or services; charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; providing a different level or quality of goods or services; or suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
Exercising California privacy rights
If you are a California resident and would like to exercise any of your rights, you may do so by going to our website at www.lifesum.com/californiaprivacyrights, emailing us at https://lifesum.com/contact, or calling +1 (800) 944 1644. You may also contact us directly in the Lifesum app via Me / Settings / Support and then clicking on the contact button in that section.

ManagingLife Inc.'s Privacy Policy
Version 2.2, Last Updated: February 22, 2024


ManagingLife, Inc. (“ManagingLife,” “we,” or “us”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information that we collect through:
* Websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Websites”);
* Software applications, such as the Manage My Pain app, made available by us (the “Apps”);
* Our pages on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, (collectively, our “Social Media Pages”);
* Emails we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy or other communications with you (collectively, our “Communications”); and
* Offline business interactions you have with us.
Collectively, we refer to the Websites, Apps, Social Media Pages, Communications, and offline business interactions as the “Services.”




OFFLINE AND ONLINE MODE


You can use our Apps in offline and online mode. In the offline mode, which is the standard setting, your information is stored only on your device, and is not accessed by us. In the offline mode, the Apps allow you to manage your own information on your own device. Certain functionalities of the Apps require that information is shared and are therefore not available in offline mode. This is, for example, the sharing of your pain records with a health care provider of your choice, or generating pain reports. You can switch from offline mode to online mode by creating an account and logging into your Apps account, and back to offline mode by logging out of your Apps account.




PERSONAL INFORMATION


“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual.




The Apps collect crash reports, which can be turned off in the “Settings” menu and include the following Personal Information:
* User ID
* Device information (such as your device’s make and model)
* App version


When you contact us via any of our Services, we collect the following Personal Information:
* Email address
* User ID
* Device information (such as your device’s make and model)
* App version


If you choose to use the Apps in online mode, we collect Personal Information including:
* Account information (such as, your email address, IP address, and password);
* Profile information you choose to include (such as, name, medications, pain conditions, birthdate, height, weight, gender, and place of residence);
* Pain records and daily reflections you choose to create (which may include information such as, location, associated symptoms, characteristics, aggravating/alleviating factors, timing, environment, severity, meaningful activities and notes); and
* Responses you choose to submit for questionnaires assigned to you.




Collection of Personal Information


We and our service providers collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:




* Through the Services.
We collect Personal Information through the Services, for example, when you register an account to access the Services, use the Apps, share information via the Apps in online mode, contact customer service.




* From Other Sources.
If you choose to create an account on the Services and sign in by using another service provider such as Apple, Google or Facebook, you share certain Personal Information from that service provider with us, for example, your name, email address, or photo, or other information you make accessible to us when you connect your social media account to your Apps account.


We need to collect Personal Information to provide the requested Services to you. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide all the Services. If you disclose any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.




Use of Personal Information


We and our service providers use Personal Information for the following purposes:

We engage in these activities based on our legitimate interest.


* Accomplishing our business purposes.
- For data analysis, for example, to improve the Services;

We predominantly process your personal data in the UK or the EEA. However, we may sometimes transfer your personal data outside of the UK and EEA to certain third parties (including those listed above). Where we make such a transfer, we will only do so in accordance with the requirements set out in applicable law (such as to a country deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, or by using specific contracts approved by the UK Government or the European Commission).
We may also have to share your personal data with third parties where we are required to do so to:
1. comply with the law;
2. enforce or apply our Terms; or 
3. protect the rights, property, or safety of Runna, our users or others.
5. User Account Assistance Mode
In certain circumstances, and only at the explicit request and with the express consent of the user, a Runna employee may activate a temporary User Account Assistance Mode to view the user’s account from their perspective. This feature is designed solely to assist the user with troubleshooting or resolving specific issues within the app. When this mode is activated:
1. The Runna employee may view the user’s activity data but will not have access to location or other health data.
2. Access to this mode is strictly limited to a small, designated group of Runna employees who have been specifically trained and informed of their confidentiality obligations.
3. A secure authentication mechanism (such as a one-time code) will be used to ensure that only authorized employees can access this mode.
4. User consent for this mode must be provided explicitly for each instance it is activated and may be withdrawn at any time.
Runna takes security and privacy seriously and employs robust safeguards to ensure this mode is used responsibly and securely. If you have any questions about this feature, please contact us at support@runna.com.
6.  How is my information protected?
We work to protect the security of your personal data during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. If transactions are processed on our Services, transaction information is transmitted in encrypted form using industry-standard SSL connections to help protect such information from interception. We restrict authorized access to your personal data to those persons who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
Runna follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once Runna receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Runna strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
We will not sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.
Should a data breach occur that presents a high risk we shall inform the appropriate authorities within 72 hours of the breach and, if required or otherwise appropriate, we shall inform you.
7. What are my rights in respect of the personal data you hold?
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to request:
1. access to your personal data (commonly known as a ""subject access request""):
   1. this enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
1. correction of your data:
   1. this enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you;
2. erasure of your data:
   1. this enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing.
3. restriction of processing of your data:
   1. this enables you to ask us to suspend processing where you contest its accuracy, object to its processing, or require us to retain it for legal claims;
4. portability of your data:
   1. this enables you to receive your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to request its transfer to another controller where technically feasible;
5. objection to processing of your data:
   1. this enables you to object where we process your data based on legitimate interests. We must stop processing unless we demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds or need it for legal claims;
6. objection to automated decision-making and profiling of your data:
   1. this enables you to request human intervention where decisions based solely on automated processing significantly affect you, unless such processing is necessary for a contract, authorised by law, or based on your explicit consent; and
7. withdrawal of consent for processing of your data:
   1. this enables you to withdraw your consent at any time where we rely on it to process your data. This will not affect past processing but may impact our ability to provide certain services.
If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or you have any questions on how we use your personal data, please reach out to us via email at support@runna.com.
8.  What is your policy regarding children?
Our services are not intended for children under 18 years of age. If you are under this age, you should not use the Services. Our Services use technical measures to prevent children under 18 years of age from creating an account and therefore we do not knowingly collect personal data from any persons under such age. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete that information, terminate that person's account, and restrict access to that person.
If you are a parent that has become aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

6. Data Collection Technologies and Cookies
As is true of many digital properties, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain information from or in connection with your device when visiting or interacting with our Services, such as:
* Log Data, including internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, device type and version, browser type and version, browser ID, the URL visited and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, other user agent string data, the time spent on our Services, and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Services.

* Location Data, such as general geographic location which can be inferred based on your IP address.
We and our third-party Service Providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, SDKs, embedded scripts, and data collection technologies (“cookies”) to automatically collect this information. We may use this information to monitor and analyze how you use and interact with our Services.
We use information gathered from these technologies so that we can analyze trends, administer the Services, and track users’ movements around the Services.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to change the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Be aware that disabling cookies may negatively affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies may result in also disabling certain functionalities and features of the Services.
Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would provide us with information about your access to and engagement with the email and its contents.
Do Not Track: Please note that our Services are not presently configured to respond to “do not track” or “DNT” signals from web browsers or mobile devices. As such, we do not recognize or respond to Do Not Track requests. We do, however, recognize and respond to Global Privacy Control or “GPC” browser signals, which allow you to control your online privacy by communicating your personal tracking preferences to participating websites.
7. Retention and Security
We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your Account is active, as needed to provide you Services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as your login credentials), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Information for Visitors from Outside of the United States: We are committed to complying with this Privacy Policy and the data protection laws that apply to our collection and use of your Personal Information. We are located in the United States, where the laws may be different and, in some cases, less protective than the laws of other countries. By providing us with your Personal Information and using the Services, you acknowledge that your Personal Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries where we and our vendors operate.
Social Media Widgets: Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the “Share this” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites (collectively referred to as “Features”). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. The Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these Features on a third-party site are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Links to Other Sites: The Services may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by SimplePractice.

Stardust Privacy Policy
Last Updated: May 14, 2024
This Privacy Policy describes how Stardust (""Stardust,"" ""we"", or ""us"") collects, uses, discloses and otherwise processes information about you. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you access or use our websites, mobile applications, and other online products and services that link to this Privacy Policy (the ""Services""), or when you otherwise interact with us, such as through our customer support channels.

You can also find our Health Data Privacy Policy here.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the ""Last Updated"" date above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the ""Last Updated"" date. If we make material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the Services or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
Collection of Information
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information directly from you when you register an account on our app, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.
The categories of information we collect include:
● Identifiers: we collect your name and birthdate. We also collect your email address, phone number, and log-in credentials but we store those separately with a third-party privacy-focused authentication platform.
● Health Data: we collect reproductive or sexual health information, including menstrual activity, fertility, pregnancy information, and sexual activity; and information about your health conditions, symptoms, and use of medications.
Please note that we do NOT associate your Health Data with your contact information (e.g., email address used for account login, password, email, and phone number). Instead, we generate an identifier that we associate with your Health Data.
● Financial Information: we engage third party payment processors to collect your payment information for our paid features or merchandise.
Communication Information: we collect information included in your communications with us.
We may also collect any other information you choose to provide.
Information We Collect from Other Sources
We may collect information from the following third-party sources:
● Third-Party Apps: If you connect third-party apps to the Services, we may collect certain information from such third-party apps under your direction. For example, if you connect Apple HealthKit or Google Health with the Services, we may import certain information under your direction such as step count. If you connect the Services with your Oura ring we will collect sleep information and basal body temperature.
● Third-Party Logins: Additionally, if you create or log into your Stardust account through a third-party platform (such as Apple or Google), we will have access to certain information made available by that platform, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.
● Social Media Platforms: We may also collect information you share when you interact with us on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
Derived Information
We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your approximate location based on your IP address and may infer your interests based on your browsing behavior and past activities.
Cookies
Like most companies, we use cookies and similar technologies in our Services. The technologies we use include the following:
● Cookies which are small data files stored on your browser or device.
● Pixels, which are small images on a web page or in an email. Pixels collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies and be used to track your use of or interaction with one or more websites.
● SDKs, or software development kits, which are software packages containing tools that help build mobile apps and introduce new features or functionality.
We refer to these technologies collectively as ""cookies"". You can find information about cookies and how they work at www.allaboutcookies.org.
First-Party and Third-Party Cookies
Some cookies are referred to as ""first-party"" which means they are placed by the website you are visiting or the app you are using - so in our case first party cookies and pixels are placed by our Services. ""Third-party"" cookies are placed by other organizations (with our permission) via our Services. They work by collecting information from your device and passing it directly back to the third-party. For example, we partner with third-party analytics providers that set cookies when you visit our Services.

Legal Bases of Processing
For users located in jurisdictions that require certain bases for processing personal information, including the EEA and the UK, our processing of your personal information is carried out under the following legal bases:
● The processing is necessary for us to provide you with the Services you request, or to respond to your inquiries, such as to comply with our contractual obligation to fulfill transactional services.
● We have a legal obligation to process your personal information, such as compliance with applicable tax and other government regulations or compliance with a court order or binding law enforcement request.
● The processing is to protect your vital interests, or those of others.
● We have a legitimate interest in carrying out the processing activity. In particular, we have a legitimate interest to:
○ Analyze and improve the safety and security of the Service. This includes implementing and enhancing security measures and safeguards and protecting against fraud, spam, and abuse.
○ Maintain and improve the Service.
○ Operate the Service and provide you with certain information and communications tailored to, and in accordance with, your preferences.
● You have consented to the processing of your personal information. When you consent, you may change your mind at any time.
Given the nature of our business, we may process special categories of your personal information in the form of health information. This information includes diabetes therapy data, such as your glucose levels, biometrics, related exercise and eating habits, and lab charts. We will only process this information in accordance with applicable law such as obtaining your explicit consent or where processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health.
Transfers of Personal Information for Data Subjects located in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant ""adequacy decisions"" from the European Commission, ""adequacy regulations"" from the Secretary of State in the UK, and the adequacy assessment from the Swiss Federal Council, as applicable (together referred to as ""EEA/UK/Swiss adequacy decisions"").
Some EEA /UK/Swiss adequacy decisions require Tandem to take steps in order for relevant transfers to be covered, in particular for transfers to the U.S. under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (""EU-U.S. DPF""), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (""UK Extension""), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (""Swiss-U.S. DPF"") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to:
● the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (""EU-U.S. DPF Principles"") with regard to the processing of personal information received from the EEA in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the UK in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF; and
● the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (""Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles"") with regard to the processing of personal information received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.
To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (""DPF"") and to view our certification, see here. It is important however for us to provide you with the following information about our certification:
● We will only rely on the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as transfer mechanisms under the applicable data protection laws, once respectively (i) the adequacy regulations implementing the data bridge for the UK Extension; and/or (ii) the Swiss Federal Council's recognition of adequacy of the Swiss-U.S. DPF, enter into force.
● We are responsible for the processing of personal information received under each DPF and, subsequently, transfers to a third party acting on our behalf. We comply with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal information we receive in reliance on the EU-U.S. / Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the UK Extension, including the onward transfer liability provisions. In particular, where we have received your personal information in the U.S. in reliance upon the EU-U.S. / Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the UK Extension, if we subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting on our behalf, and that third party processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, we will remain liable unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
● With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to each of the DPFs, Tandem is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
● If you want to contact us with any inquiries or complaints regarding our reliance on the DPFs, you can email us at privacy@tandemdiabetes.com or please see the How to Contact Us section at the end of this Privacy Notice.
● If you have an unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you can contact the individual panel established by the EU DPAs and, as applicable, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) (and the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA)), and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) free of charge to make a complaint. Tandem commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of this panel. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF website you may also invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we take appropriate safeguards to require your personal information will remain protected. The safeguards we use under GDPR, include the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (""SCCs"") as issued on 4 June 2021, in the form of modules 1 (controller to controller), module 2 (controller to processor), module 3 (processor to processor) and/or module 4 (processor to controller), as appropriate depending on our relationship with the recipient(s). We incorporate the UK's International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission SCCs as permitted under Article 46 of the UK GDPR, when transferring personal information protected under UK GDPR and the Swiss Addendum to the SCCs as provided by the FDPIC in its statement of 27 August 2021.
Our SCCs can be provided on request. Please note some sensitive commercial information may be redacted. For details of what personal information may be transferred to group entities or third parties, please see the Disclosing Your Information section of this Privacy Notice above.
In exceptional circumstances, personal information may also be transferred to countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations on the basis of a derogation. A derogation may apply, for example, in case of legal proceedings abroad, if transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract, if you have consented to the transfer, or if the data has been made generally available by you and you have not objected to the processing.

"manual_privacy_policies/Waterllama.txt","Waterllama","PRIVACY POLICY This Privacy Policy was updated on August 20, 2025 and is effective for new and existing users of the app “Water tracker Waterllama” (Application). General statement Your privacy is critically important to us. Your data is your own. We make no claims to it and will only use it according to the policies outlined below. This policy was written in English. To the extent a translated version exists and that version conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time as our Application changes. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, the updated Privacy Policy will be posted in the Application in a timely manner. This policy will always be posted within the Mobile App. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Application and the choices you have associated with that data. The Application allows you to measure your daily activity. It is not transmitted outside of the App. No Personally-Identifying Information is transmitted to external locations when using the Application. The Application transmits non-personally identifiable information such as device type and operating system version. This is used in aggregate to help facilitate development decisions. We use your data to provide and improve the Application. By using the Application, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of use. If you choose to have the Application integrate with HealthKit then the application will have access only to the health data types you opt-in to access. The health data read from HealthKit is used for display within the app. It is not collected or disclosed outside of your local installation of the app. Only those data types relevant to the app are accessed. The Application requests permission to write certain data types into your HealthKit data store. These are used when you are tracking statistical information about fluids you drink. In no case is your health data ever transferred to a 3rd party. It is only ever kept within the application container or transferred to your personal HealthKit data store as per your permission choices. User data collected from Apple Health will never be used for marketing, advertising purposes or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health management, or for the purpose of health research, and then only with permission. DEFINITIONS Personal Data Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession). Usage Data Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Application or from the Application infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of an App visit). Data Subject Data Subject is any living individual who is the subject of Personal Data. User The User is the individual using our Application. The User corresponds to the Data Subject, who is the subject of Personal Data. 1. INTRODUCTION AND REMARKS 1.1. About Us Provider of this Application and responsible person is LLAMA LUNA APPS INC., 8571 WILTSHIRE ST, VANCOUVER, BC, V6P 5H6, CANADA (referred to as the “Provider” as well as “we”, “us” etc.). “Water tracker Waterllama” (Application) strongly believes that you have the right to control the use of your personal information, and that your privacy must be respected. We strictly limit the collection and processing of your personal data, and to the best of our abilities we will work only with other organisations who do the same. We will not use personal data that you provide to us in a manner inconsistent with the purposes for which you provided it to us, as set out below. We do not sell, rent or lease personal data. We will vigorously challenge any attempts by government agencies or private sector organisations to gain access to any information that you give us. 1.2. Our Core Principles With this Privacy Policy we would like to inform you how we process data while providing you with the Water tracker Waterllama - application software designed for smartphones and /or tablet computers (the “Application”), - which allows Users to track water intake. The protection of your privacy is of the utmost importance to us, which is why it goes without saying that we comply with the statutory provisions on data protection. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY, AS YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APPLICATION SIGNIFIES THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS WITHIN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR CONTINUE TO USE THE APPLICATION, OR OTHERWISE SUBMIT YOUR DATA. THIS POLICY MAY BE AMENDED OR UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME, SO PLEASE CHECK IT REGULARLY FOR UPDATES. You can find the definitions of terms that are not specified in this Privacy Policy, in our Terms of Use. 1.3. What information does the Application obtain The Application does not provide an option to create an account therefore, we do not store nor have access to your entries and data. Your data are stored locally only on your device and personal iCloud. We use your data to provide and improve the Application. We obtain your email address when you request support via email. We use your email only to contact you to provide support, feedback or important information. 1.4. What Data is Being Logged by Default By continuing to use this Application, you’ve agreed to data collection, the Application collects some data that are essential for us to deliver our services, to understand your needs and to improve our services. The Application automatically collect certain information that does not personally identify our end users who access or use Application. This information includes: a) Usage data (product interaction: such as Application launches, taps, clicks, scrolling information, or other information about how user interact with the Application; advertising data: such as information about the advertisements user have viewed; other usage data: any other data about user activity in the Application). b) Diagnostics (crash data: such as crash logs; performance data: such as launch time, hang rate, or energy use; other diagnostic data: any other data collected for the purposes of measuring technical diagnostics related to the Application). The Application does NOT collect any personal data that directly identifies you such as your name, surname, or anything you type within the Application. The Application also does NOT collect any data about your health and fitness and it will NOT be used to track users. Generally, we do not collect or keep a record of sensitive personal data and only do so in very limited circumstances, primarily when an individual has chosen to provide us with this data. On occasion we may also process sensitive personal data of others engaging with Application, for example where an individual provides us with information relating to accessibility needs for the purpose of obtaining and/or exchanging data or where an individual contacts Application and their communication includes sensitive personal data. We do not use this data for any other purpose other than that for which it is provided. Notice: health, fitness, and medical data are especially sensitive and apps in this space have some additional rules to make sure customer privacy is protected. Apps may not use or disclose to third parties data gathered in the health, fitness, and medical research context for advertising, marketing, or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health management, or for the purpose of health research, and then only with permission. Health data doesn't only mean ""obvious"" information about people's medical conditions. Health data can include information that, when combined with other information, tells you something about a person's health. This sort of indirectly identifying personal data could include information collected from sensors on smart devices, e.g. sleep trackers, step counters, heart rate monitors. Privacy is an internationally recognised human right. However, we appreciate that in certain circumstances, the data you submit on this app may reveal data that could be considered sensitive personal data (reflective of your political or philosophical views) e.g. indicating that you are interested in privacy in a specific country, have sent a letter to a specific company to complain about its privacy practices and so on. When using our Application, you are not required, as a statutory requirement or as a necessity to enter into a contract, to provide us with personal data for processing as described in the Policy. Our Application, however, may require minimal information, such as an email address, for you to take an action. You can create an account without providing any personal data other than your email address, but you can choose to provide us with additional information. In a mobile Application environment when data is collected about or from a mobile device, the personal nature of mobile device usage implies that such data has to be considered as personal data as in the meaning of the protection of personal data. Thus, not only data on the device that is personal and private by nature, such as pictures, messages, emails, agenda items, etc. qualifies as personal data, but also data that is related to the device, such as device identifiers, environmental aspects, such as the device’s location, and data related to its use, including logs containing usage data related to specific apps. When accessing sensitive (special categories of) data, stricter requirements. Relevant special categories of data include data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, genetic biometric and health data or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. When the use of an app results in the processing of such sensitive data, for instance in health apps, typically, we have to ensure that there is explicit consent of the user for the processing of these data for particular specified purposes. Relevant special categories of data include data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, genetic biometric and health data or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. When the use of an app results in the processing of such sensitive data, for instance in health or dating apps, typically, the controller has to ensure that there is explicit consent of the user for the processing of these data for particular specified purposes. It is possible that certain information processed in the mobile context, such as images, messages, user inputs, contain data that have to be qualified as sensitive data. Images are not generally considered sensitive data but images of persons can reveal their racial or ethnic origin, people’s private messages can reveal people’s beliefs and attitudes and health status. The same can be true for metadata, which collected over time can provide a uniquely invasive profile of users. While location data are not included in the list of special data categories, the processing of location data is generally considered to require special attention to the question of necessity and proportionality and major mobile OSs have implemented special mechanisms for location data transparency and user consent. By default, we do not track your location. Also, the App does not collect, transmit, and/or use user location data. While indicating this provision as a factual basis for the operation of the Application, we will separately note that we may use and store information about your location if you give us permission to do so (“Location Data”). If the Application will collect, transmit or use location data, it will notify and obtain consent from the user before collecting, transmitting and/or using such data. At the same time, we notify you that location services may be used by the App only when they are directly related to the functions and services provided by the App. We use this data to provide features of our Application, to improve and customize our Application. You can enable or disable location services when you use our Application at any time, through your device settings. Health, fitness, and medical data are especially sensitive and apps in this space have some additional rules to make sure customer privacy is protected: (i) Application may not use or disclose to third parties data gathered in the health, fitness, and medical research context - including from the HealthKit API, Apple Health or health-related human subject research - for advertising, marketing, or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health management, or for the purpose of health research, and then only with permission. Application may, however, use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user. We may collect this data in order to provide to you the access to the App including reporting and analytics, fitness and nutrition recommendations, participation in online challenges, and product and feature recommendations. In particular, we may also collect information to understand user preferences and improve their experience and enjoyment of our app. We may make announcements about personalized promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and other news about our app to provide the best possible benefit to each direct user. The information we receive may also be used to send users relevant necessary and/or requested information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, push notifications, security alerts, support messages, and administrative messages. The information received from users is also used to resolve disputes as quickly as possible, as well as to personalize and provide each and every one of our users with the best online experience and customer support. That said, separately note that any such user benefits will not include the use or disclosure of HealthKit data for advertising, marketing or other use-based data mining purposes (ii) Application must not write false or inaccurate data into HealthKit or any other medical research or health management apps, and not store personal health information in iCloud. (iii) We and our Application may not use the HealthKit APIs or any information obtained through the HealthKit APIs for any purpose other than providing health, motion, and/or fitness services in connection with our Application (e.g., not for serving advertising). (iiii) We and our Application must not use the HealthKit APIs or any information obtained through the HealthKit APIs to disclose or provide an end-user’s health, motion, and/or fitness information to a third party without prior express end-user consent, and then only for purposes of enabling the third party to provide health, motion, and/or fitness services as permitted herein. For example, we do not share or sell an end-user’s health information collected through the HealthKit APIs to advertising platforms, data brokers, or information resellers. For clarity, You may allow end-users to consent to share their data with third parties for medical research purposes. 1.5. Data Use We process your data for the following purposes: a) HealthKit data used only to provide health, motion or fitness services in connection with the App. HealthKit data will not be used for marketing, advertising or use-based data mining, including by third parties. b) Analytics (using data to evaluate user behavior, including to understand the effectiveness of existing product features, plan new features, or measure audience size or characteristics). c) Product personalization (customizing what user see, such as a list of recommended products, posts, or suggestions). d) To administer our Application functionality (such as to authenticate user in the Application, enable features, prevent fraud, implement security measures, ensure server uptime, minimize Application crashes, improve scalability and performance, or perform customer support). e) For corresponding with user (to respond to any communications, queries or requests for information or services from you, howsoever received). f) To comply with our legal or regulatory obligations. g) To establish, exercise or defend legal claims. The Application may contain links to other websites or applications for whose content, function and compliance we are not responsible. Please inform yourself about the data protection regulations of the respective web pages with the respective operators. The Application will only process personal data when we have a legal basis for doing so. The legal basis that we will rely on will depend on the circumstances in which we collect and use your personal data. In almost all cases, the relevant legal basis to process personal data is that the processing will be one of the following: (i) Based on your consent to use your data in a certain way (for example, to communicate with you through our mailing list). Your consent may subsequently be withdrawn at any time by editing your preferences or contacting us as specified in this Policy without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. (ii) Necessary in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract or for the performance of a contract (for example, for human resources management and to manage those carrying out work on behalf of PI); (iii) Necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable regulatory obligations and employment law); (iiii) Necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to administer our apps, to carry out research and investigations consistent with our mission). We will only rely on this legal basis where we’ve identified the purpose (the legitimate interest), assessed that the processing is necessary for that purpose and conducted a balancing test to ensure that this interest is not overridden by the interests, rights and freedoms of the individual. (iiii) Children's Privacy: Our Application does not address anyone under the age of 18 (""Children""). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. 1.6. Security We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of data and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to data. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of data. You acknowledge that clearing Application data or uninstalling this application from your device or losing your device or device problem could result in loss of all data. You are responsible for backing up your data. 1.7. Purchases Your purchases in the App Store and in-app-purchases are handled by Apple. We do not get access to your funds and banking data. 2. USER RIGHTS 2.1. Storage Period of the Collected Data We store your data, a) if you have consented to the processing (namely, your choice to access or use the Application constitutes your agreement to Terms of use and acknowledgement of our Privacy Policy) at most until you revoke your consent (User deletes the Application from his/her smartphone or tablet computer. User independently deletes the data about the Application in personal iCloud); b) if we need the data for the execution of a contract, at the most as long as the contractual relationship with you exists or legal retention periods run; c) if we use the data on the basis of a justified interest, at the most as long as your interest in deletion or anonymization does not prevail; d) if legal (e.g. commercial code, tax code) exist, until the end of these storage obligations. 2.2. Data Sources All the data we receive are received from you and/or your device only. 2.3. Legitimate Interests When processing your data, we pursue the following legitimate interests: a) The improvement of our offer, b) The production of statistics, c) Informing about the Application's news and updates. d) The storage of our correspondence with you. e) To comply with a legal obligation f) To protect and defend the rights or property of Provider g) To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Application h) To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public i) To protect against legal liability 2.4. Making contact We may provide emails or forms to which user of the Application can send us questions or comments, or which users can use to request customer support. In the process of receiving and responding to such requests, we may collect personal information about you, such as your email address or any other personal data contained in the body of your email message. By allowing you to send us these requests, we are not attempting to solicit personal information from you. We only use the information for the purpose of responding to your questions and/or comments or to provide customer support.

3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.

If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
■ Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
■ Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
■ Legitimate Interests.

For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
■ Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users
■ Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities
■ __________

If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
■ If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
■ For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
■ For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
■ If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
■ For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
■ If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
■ If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
■ If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
■ If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
■ If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
■ If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations
■ We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments

In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?
In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.

Our servers are located in the United States, Netherlands and France. Regardless of your location, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored by, and processed by us in our facilities and in the facilities of the third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see ""WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?"" above), including facilities in the United States, and other countries.

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.

European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:

We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section ""HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"" below.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
 
If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section ""HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
Account Information
If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
■ Contact us using the contact information provided.
■ Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. For further information, please see our Cookie Notice: https://app.termly.io/policy-viewer/policy.html?policyUUID=1f11acd7-0029-4b00-bd21-63ebbdb6c828.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at team@yuka.io.

12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (""DNT"") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

13. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?
In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information.

Effective Date: December 27th, 2024
At ZocDoc, Inc. (“Zocdoc,” “we,” or “us”), we are committed to protecting your privacy. We take great care with your personal information that we gather when you access or use zocdoc.com and related websites, applications, and services owned and operated by Zocdoc and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”). 
This Privacy Policy is meant to help the users of our Services (“Users”, “you,” or “your”) understand how we treat your Personal Data. In addition to Users who create a Zocdoc account to use the Services, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Users” also includes users of our Services who do not have a Zocdoc account (for example, if you visit our websites or download our mobile application without creating a Zocdoc account) (“Visitors”). Please note that some of our Services, including the ability to book an appointment through our Services are limited to Users with a Zocdoc account. For doctors, dentists, or other healthcare providers that use our marketing services, please click here to review the categories of information we collect. 
BY USING OR ACCESSING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES AND POLICIES OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT THAT WE WILL COLLECT, USE, AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION IN THE WAYS DESCRIBED HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.

HIPAA and PHI
Certain demographic, health and/or health-related information that Zocdoc collects about Users on behalf of our Healthcare Providers as part of providing the Services may be “protected health information” (“PHI”) governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Specifically, this may be true when (i) Zocdoc is providing administrative, operational, or other services to a Healthcare Provider that is a “Covered Entity” (as defined by HIPAA); and (ii) in order to provide those services, Zocdoc receives identifiable information about a User on behalf of the Healthcare Provider, where Zocdoc is acting as a “Business Associate” (as defined by HIPAA); and (iii) this identifiable information is regulated as PHI.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to PHI, which is instead regulated by HIPAA. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. Please read the Notice of Privacy Practices of your Healthcare Provider to understand how your PHI can be used and disclosed.
Personal data that a User provides to Zocdoc when Zocdoc is not acting as a Business Associate is not PHI and Zocdoc’s use of this information is therefore covered by this Privacy Policy. To provide just a few examples, we are collecting personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you (i) create an account, (ii) search for Healthcare Providers or available appointments with Healthcare Providers; (iii) post reviews; (iv) provide device/IP Information or Web Analytics information by browsing our websites (see below); or (v) direct your Covered Entity healthcare provider to disclose PHI to Zocdoc outside of its Business Associate capacity (e.g. pursuant to a HIPAA Authorization or access request).
Categories of Personal Data We Collect
Each table below details the categories of Personal Data that we may collect and may have collected about you over the past twelve (12) months, depending on your relationship with Zocdoc. Please note that multiple tables may apply to you depending on how you interact with us or our Services. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual, and includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. For each category of Personal Data, these subsections also set out the source of that Personal Data, our commercial or business purpose for collecting that Personal Data, and the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Data. More information regarding those sources and categories are set forth below.

Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out
The following sections provide additional information about how we collect your Personal Data.
Cookies
The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, mobile identifiers, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your device and web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services. We do this to analyze trends, learn about and advertise to our user base, and operate and improve our Services. For example, we use Cookies to tailor the Services or customize advertisements on and off of our Service by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customizing user experiences with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).
We use the following types of Cookies:
* Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required to provide you with features or services you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into the secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.
* Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services, how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and text typed into the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns to help us improve our campaigns and the content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on page.
* Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests to provide advertising on and off of our Service that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.”
* Web Beacons. Web Beacons (e.g., clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a webpage or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the web services of selected advertisers, and the emails, special promotions, or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers’ web services or opening emails, and for what purpose. Also, it allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).
* Mobile Device Identifiers. Mobile device identifiers help Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile devices and data, activities occurring on and through it, and the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable the collection of Personal Data, such as media access control, address, location, and tracking data, including without limitation IP address, domain server, type of device(s) used to access the Services, web browser(s) used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, other statistics, and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services.
* Cross Device Matching. To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data). We may also provide de-identified data to these partners to supplement this analysis. Based on this data, we may display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.
You can opt-out of all unessential Cookies at any time here. You can also decide whether to accept Cookies through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You may also be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your device. Although you are not required to accept Zocdoc’s Cookies, if you block, reject, or delete them, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you access the Services, as some functionalities may not work.
To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu. To find more information about Cookies, including how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit here.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. We generally do not support “Do Not Track” requests sent from a browser at this time. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit here. However, if you are a resident of state with an applicable privacy law, we treat opt-out preference signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal data, or of opting out of the processing of personal data for targeted advertising, as applicable, to the extent such signals are present and readable.
Information about Interest-Based Advertisements
We may serve advertisements and allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to collect data on the Services and serve advertisements on and off of the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you or derived or inferred from the online activity or usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may include IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, webpage interactions, geographic location, and demographic information, such as gender and age range. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including Web Beacons, from an ad network to you through the Services. Web Beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. This information helps Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web Beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a webpage from their site.
Please note that even after opting out of Interest-Based Ads, you may still see Zocdoc advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you).
Data Security
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we process that data. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.
For example, the Services use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data. We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad. We maintain what we consider industry-standard backup and archival systems. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanisms; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, for example, by making good faith efforts to store Personal Data in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot and do not guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.
Data Retention
We retain Personal Data about you as necessary to provide our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, provide our Services, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in a de-identified and/or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
For example:
* We retain your account information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
* We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively, and efficiently.
* We retain any PHI consistent with our obligations under our Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities and HIPAA.
Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to or intended for use by anyone under 18 years of age.If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. By accessing, using, and/or submitting information to or through the Services, you represent that you are at least the age of 18. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have received any Personal Data directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving their parent’s verified consent, we will use that Personal Data only to respond directly to that child (or their parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that they cannot use the Services. We will then subsequently delete that child’s Personal Data. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at Privacy@zocdoc.com.
If you are between the age 13 and 18, you may use the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, in compliance with the Agreement, use the Services on behalf of such minor child. Any information that you provide us while using the Services on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Data as otherwise provided herein.
If you use the Services on behalf of another person, regardless of age, you agree that Zocdoc may contact you for any communication made in connection with providing the Services or any legally required communications. You further agree to forward or share any such communication with any person for whom you are using the Services on behalf of.
Controlling Your Personal Data and Notifications
If you are a registered User of the Services, you can modify certain Personal Data or account information by logging in and accessing your account. If you wish to close your account, please e-mail us at Privacy@zocdoc.com. Zocdoc will use reasonable efforts to delete your account as soon as reasonably possible. Please note, however, that Zocdoc reserves the right to retain information from closed accounts consistent with our internal data retention policies and procedures.
You must promptly notify us if any of your account data is lost, stolen, or used without permission.
California Rights and Disclosures
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Data. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how California residents can exercise these rights. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at Consumer-Privacy@zocdoc.com and indicate “California Rights” in the subject line of your communication.Because of the minimal Personal Data we collect and retain about Visitors, certain rights may not be afforded to you (as further described below). Additionally, please note that these rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions under applicable law, which may permit or require us to deny your request. Lastly, we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a “service provider” under the CCPA, you may need to contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
Access
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data, including the following:
* The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
* The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
* The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
* The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each third-party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data purchased by third-party recipients.
Deletion
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
Correction
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, if we decide, based on the totality of circumstances related to your Personal Data, that such data is correct. If your correction request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your request.
Processing of Sensitive Personal Data Opt-Out
If you have a Zocdoc account, we may collect Personal Data that is considered “sensitive” under the CCPA. Because we may use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those set forth in section 7027(m) of the CCPA regulations, California residents have the right to request that we limit the use or sharing of their Sensitive Personal Information (“Right to Limit”). The Right to Limit allows California residents to direct a business that collects Sensitive Personal Information to limit its use of this information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services, to perform the services set forth in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), and (8) of subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140, and as authorized in the CCPA regulations.
Personal Data Sharing or Selling
Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights when a business “shares” or “sells” Personal Data with third parties for purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising. While Zocdoc does not sell Users’ information to unaffiliated parties for money, we do share Cookies and other web data to advertising and marketing partners in a manner which might be considered “selling” or “sharing” your Personal Data as those terms are defined under the CCPA. Accordingly, we have shared and sold the foregoing categories of Personal Data for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising:
* User Demographic data (not Sensitive Demographic Data) such as gender or zipcode;
* Online Identifiers
* Web analytics
As described in the “Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out” section above, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit. Under the laws of the CCPA, “sharing” of a User’s web analytics is also considered “selling.” You can opt out of such data selling and/or sharing by following the instructions in this section.
We share Personal Data with the following categories of third parties:
* Advertising partners
Over the past 12 months, we have shared Personal Data with the categories of third parties listed above for the following purposes:
* Marketing and advertising the Services.
* Showing you advertisements, including interest-based or online behavioral advertising.
Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sharing of your Personal Data for at least 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you with a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
Financial Incentives
At Zocdoc, we value your data because it allows us to better understand your goals and preferences and improve our products and services to better serve you. From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive for your participation in our user research. The financial incentive we offer is based on our good faith determination of the estimated value of your data. If you participate in the research, you may be asked to submit Personal Data in surveys, forms, or through your account. The Personal Data you submit in connection with this research will only be used internally to improve our product; we will never share or sell this data to third parties.
Through your participation in the research, we may collect the following categories of Personal Data about you:
* Identifiers, such as your name, address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.
* Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law.
* Commercial information, such as products or services you’ve purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
* Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as your browsing history, search history, and information regarding your interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement.
* Geolocation data.
* Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information. For example, we may collect your voice recordings.
* Professional or employment-related information.
* Education information, defined as information that is not publicly available personally identifiable information as defined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99).
* Any other Personal Data you may enter into a free-form field of our surveys or forms.
* Inferences drawn from any of the foregoing categories of Personal Data.
Participation in the financial incentive is entirely optional. If you participate in a financial incentive, you agree that we are not required to comply with your right to know or delete Personal Data collected in exchange for the financial incentive. If you are a participant in a financial incentive we offer, you may withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by emailing us at the email address provided to you with your individual notice of the financial incentive.

If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington State (solely with respect to consumer health information) or another state with a similar comprehensive consumer privacy law, you may have certain rights regarding your information. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that in some cases, we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a “processor” (or similar term) under the applicable privacy law, you may need to contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data. Also, because of the minimal Personal Data we collect and retain about Visitors, certain rights may not be afforded to you (as further described below). Lastly, please note that these rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions under applicable law, which may permit or require us to deny your request.

To exercise this right, please email privacy@zocdoc.com with the subject “Oregon Access Request.”

Exercising Your Rights
To exercise the rights under the CCPA or other state laws as described above, you must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. If you are a Healthcare Provider with a profile on our Services, you do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will respond to your Valid Request within the applicable time period required by law. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
To the extent rights are afforded to you, you may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
* If you have a Zocdoc account, you can submit requests to access (by portable copy or otherwise), delete, correct through the “Privacy” tab in your account settings.
* If you have a Zocdoc account, you can opt-out from or limit the processing of sensitive information through the “Data Privacy” tab in your account settings.

This Privacy Policy is meant to help the users of our Services (“Users”, “you,” or “your”) understand how we treat your Personal Data. In addition to Users who create a Zocdoc account to use the Services, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Users” also includes users of our Services who do not have a Zocdoc account (for example, if you visit our websites or download our mobile application without creating a Zocdoc account) (“Visitors”).

For doctors, dentists, or other healthcare providers that use our marketing services, please click here to review the categories of information we collect.

HIPAA and PHI
Certain demographic, health and/or health-related information that Zocdoc collects about Users on behalf of our Healthcare Providers as part of providing the Services may be “protected health information” (“PHI”) governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Specifically, this may be true when (i) Zocdoc is providing administrative, operational, or other services to a Healthcare Provider that is a “Covered Entity” (as defined by HIPAA); and (ii) in order to provide those services, Zocdoc receives identifiable information about a User on behalf of the Healthcare Provider, where Zocdoc is acting as a “Business Associate” (as defined by HIPAA); and (iii) this identifiable information is regulated as PHI.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to PHI, which is instead regulated by HIPAA. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. Please read the Notice of Privacy Practices of your Healthcare Provider to understand how your PHI can be used and disclosed.
Personal data that a User provides to Zocdoc when Zocdoc is not acting as a Business Associate is not PHI and Zocdoc’s use of this information is therefore covered by this Privacy Policy. To provide just a few examples, we are collecting personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you (i) create an account, (ii) search for Healthcare Providers or available appointments with Healthcare Providers; (iii) post reviews; (iv) provide device/IP Information or Web Analytics information by browsing our websites (see below); or (v) direct your Covered Entity healthcare provider to disclose PHI to Zocdoc outside of its Business Associate capacity (e.g. pursuant to a HIPAA Authorization or access request).
Categories of Personal Data We Collect
Each table below details the categories of Personal Data that we may collect and may have collected about you over the past twelve (12) months, depending on your relationship with Zocdoc. Please note that multiple tables may apply to you depending on how you interact with us or our Services. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual, and includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. For each category of Personal Data, these subsections also set out the source of that Personal Data, our commercial or business purpose for collecting that Personal Data, and the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Data. More information regarding those sources and categories are set forth below.

Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out
The following sections provide additional information about how we collect your Personal Data.
Cookies


The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, mobile identifiers, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your device and web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services. We do this to analyze trends, learn about and advertise to our user base, and operate and improve our Services. For example, we use Cookies to tailor the Services or customize advertisements on and off of our Service by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customizing user experiences with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).
We use the following types of Cookies:
* Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required to provide you with features or services you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into the secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.
* Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services, how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and text typed into the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns to help us improve our campaigns and the content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on page.
* Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests to provide advertising on and off of our Service that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.”
* Web Beacons. Web Beacons (e.g., clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a webpage or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the web services of selected advertisers, and the emails, special promotions, or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers’ web services or opening emails, and for what purpose. Also, it allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).
* Mobile Device Identifiers. Mobile device identifiers help Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile devices and data, activities occurring on and through it, and the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable the collection of Personal Data, such as media access control, address, location, and tracking data, including without limitation IP address, domain server, type of device(s) used to access the Services, web browser(s) used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, other statistics, and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services.
* Cross Device Matching. To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data). We may also provide de-identified data to these partners to supplement this analysis. Based on this data, we may display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.


You can opt-out of all unessential Cookies at any time here. You can also decide whether to accept Cookies through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You may also be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your device. Although you are not required to accept Zocdoc’s Cookies, if you block, reject, or delete them, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you access the Services, as some functionalities may not work.


To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu. To find more information about Cookies, including how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit here.


Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. We generally do not support “Do Not Track” requests sent from a browser at this time. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit here. However, if you are a resident of state with an applicable privacy law, we treat opt-out preference signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal data, or of opting out of the processing of personal data for targeted advertising, as applicable, to the extent such signals are present and readable.
Information about Interest-Based Advertisements


We may serve advertisements and allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to collect data on the Services and serve advertisements on and off of the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you or derived or inferred from the online activity or usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may include IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, webpage interactions, geographic location, and demographic information, such as gender and age range. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including Web Beacons, from an ad network to you through the Services. Web Beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. This information helps Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web Beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a webpage from their site.
Please note that even after opting out of Interest-Based Ads, you may still see Zocdoc advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you).


Data Security
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we process that data. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.
For example, the Services use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data. We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad. We maintain what we consider industry-standard backup and archival systems. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanisms; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, for example, by making good faith efforts to store Personal Data in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot and do not guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.


Data Retention
We retain Personal Data about you as necessary to provide our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, provide our Services, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in a de-identified and/or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
For example:
* We retain your account information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
* We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively, and efficiently.
* We retain any PHI consistent with our obligations under our Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities and HIPAA.


Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to or intended for use by anyone under 18 years of age.If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. By accessing, using, and/or submitting information to or through the Services, you represent that you are at least the age of 18. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have received any Personal Data directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving their parent’s verified consent, we will use that Personal Data only to respond directly to that child (or their parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that they cannot use the Services. We will then subsequently delete that child’s Personal Data. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at Privacy@zocdoc.com.
If you are between the age 13 and 18, you may use the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, in compliance with the Agreement, use the Services on behalf of such minor child. Any information that you provide us while using the Services on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Data as otherwise provided herein.
If you use the Services on behalf of another person, regardless of age, you agree that Zocdoc may contact you for any communication made in connection with providing the Services or any legally required communications. You further agree to forward or share any such communication with any person for whom you are using the Services on behalf of.


Controlling Your Personal Data and Notifications
If you are a registered User of the Services, you can modify certain Personal Data or account information by logging in and accessing your account. If you wish to close your account, please e-mail us at Privacy@zocdoc.com. Zocdoc will use reasonable efforts to delete your account as soon as reasonably possible. Please note, however, that Zocdoc reserves the right to retain information from closed accounts consistent with our internal data retention policies and procedures.
You must promptly notify us if any of your account data is lost, stolen, or used without permission.


California Rights and Disclosures
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Data. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how California residents can exercise these rights. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at Consumer-Privacy@zocdoc.com and indicate “California Rights” in the subject line of your communication.Because of the minimal Personal Data we collect and retain about Visitors, certain rights may not be afforded to you (as further described below). Additionally, please note that these rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions under applicable law, which may permit or require us to deny your request. Lastly, we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a “service provider” under the CCPA, you may need to contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
Access
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data, including the following:
* The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
* The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
* The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
* The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each third-party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data purchased by third-party recipients.
Deletion
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
Correction
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, if we decide, based on the totality of circumstances related to your Personal Data, that such data is correct. If your correction request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your request.
Processing of Sensitive Personal Data Opt-Out
If you have a Zocdoc account, we may collect Personal Data that is considered “sensitive” under the CCPA. Because we may use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those set forth in section 7027(m) of the CCPA regulations, California residents have the right to request that we limit the use or sharing of their Sensitive Personal Information (“Right to Limit”). The Right to Limit allows California residents to direct a business that collects Sensitive Personal Information to limit its use of this information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services, to perform the services set forth in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), and (8) of subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140, and as authorized in the CCPA regulations.
Personal Data Sharing or Selling
Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights when a business “shares” or “sells” Personal Data with third parties for purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising. While Zocdoc does not sell Users’ information to unaffiliated parties for money, we do share Cookies and other web data to advertising and marketing partners in a manner which might be considered “selling” or “sharing” your Personal Data as those terms are defined under the CCPA. Accordingly, we have shared and sold the foregoing categories of Personal Data for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising:
* User Demographic data (not Sensitive Demographic Data) such as gender or zipcode;
* Online Identifiers
* Web analytics
As described in the “Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out” section above, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit. Under the laws of the CCPA, “sharing” of a User’s web analytics is also considered “selling.” You can opt out of such data selling and/or sharing by following the instructions in this section.
We share Personal Data with the following categories of third parties:
* Advertising partners
Over the past 12 months, we have shared Personal Data with the categories of third parties listed above for the following purposes:
* Marketing and advertising the Services.
* Showing you advertisements, including interest-based or online behavioral advertising.
Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sharing of your Personal Data for at least 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you with a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive for your participation in our user research. The financial incentive we offer is based on our good faith determination of the estimated value of your data. If you participate in the research, you may be asked to submit Personal Data in surveys, forms, or through your account.

* Inferences drawn from any of the foregoing categories of Personal Data.

Accordingly, this annex is supplementary to the information given in our Privacy Notice and applicable where the LGPD applies. 11.1 Legal Basis. The LGPD acknowledges the exercise of rights in judicial, administrative, or arbitral proceedings and protection of credit as legitimate bases for data processing. Accordingly, please note that in addition to the legal bases as set forth in Purpose and Legal Basis For Processing of Personal Data of the Privacy Notice, we might process your personal data because this is necessary to exercise our rights in judicial, administrative, or arbitral proceedings to which you and we are parties or to protect credit, where applicable. 11.2 Types of processing activities we perform.

They must also ensure strict data security standards, must not disclose your personal data without our instruction and are obliged to stop processing the personal data immediately in case of termination of the contract. If you connect to the service of one of our partners and export personal data from our app to these services, the respective partner offering the service is responsible for the data processing from the moment of the export. 11.6 Your rights.

Please note that the rights mentioned are not absolute rights. In individual cases it is possible that the exercise of these rights is opposed by rights or obligations of Runtastic or third parties. 11.7 Possibility of denying consent and the consequences. If the Privacy Notice indicates that the processing of your personal data for a certain purpose is based on your consent, please be advised that you are not obligated to give such consent and that you may revoke a consent you have given at any time. In case you do not give a certain consent or in case you revoke a consent you have given, your personal data will not be processed for this purpose (anymore).

The HIPAA Notice describes how OCN and we can use and share your PHI and also describes your rights with respect to your PHI. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the HIPAA Notice with respect to PHI, the HIPAA Notice will prevail. I.

We may also collect certain location information when you use our Services, such as your computer’s IP address, your mobile device’s GPS signal, or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers. We may use cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects, and similar technologies to automatically collect this information. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser. Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device. Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.

These third-party vendors and service-providers may monitor activity (including mouse movements and clicks) on our website and may collect, store, and use certain information, including but not limited to information regarding your device and your interactions with this website, chat messages, and information provided by you. These third-party vendors and service providers may not use your information for purposes other than those related to the services they are providing to us. Research partners. We may share your information with our research partners to conduct health-related research; such sharing may be subject to your separate written authorization. Corporate affiliates. We may share your information with our corporate affiliates that are subject to this policy. Business transfers. We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Legal purposes. We may disclose information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, law enforcement requests, legal claims or government inquiries, and to protect and defend the rights, interests, health, safety, and security of American Well, our affiliates, users, or the public. If we are legally compelled to disclose information about you to a third party, we will attempt to notify you by sending an email to the email address in our records unless doing so would violate the law or unless you have not provided your email address to us. With your consent or at your direction. We may share information for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent or direction. Outside of the use cases specified above, we will not provide your information to third parties. However, if you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, through the Services to login to the Services or to share information about your experience on the Services with others, these third-party services may be able to collect information about you, including information about your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on the third-party services about your use of the Site, in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you choose to engage in public activities on the Site or third party sites that we link to, you should be aware that any information you share there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas. You should use caution in disclosing personal information while participating in these sites. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these public areas. IV. SECURITY We use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Please note that information collected by third parties may not have the same security protections as information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information. V. YOUR CHOICES You may opt out of receiving general health and wellness or treatment options that may be relevant to you by emailing us at privacy@amwell.com. You may also request that we delete your personal information by sending us an email at privacy@amwell.com. We may not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. For more information about your choices see the HIPAA Notice referenced above.You may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your web browser settings. Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section). Please note that you may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable Local Shared Objects and similar technologies. For example, Local Shared Objects can be controlled through the instructions on Adobe’s Setting Manager page. If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you. VI. THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING, LINKS, AND CONTENT Amwell uses third party vendors and service-providers that help us provide you the Services. These third party vendors and service providers only collect information about your use of our Platform in order to support us in providing you the Services. Some of our websites may contain links to content maintained by third parties that we do not control. We allow third parties, including business partners, advertising networks, and other advertising service providers, to collect information about your online activities through cookies, pixels, local storage, and other technologies to provide you interest based advertising. These third parties may use this information to display advertisements on our websites and elsewhere online tailored to your interests, preferences, and characteristics. Some of these third parties may participate in an industry organization that gives users the opportunity to opt out of receiving ads that are tailored based on your online activities. Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative opt-out programs, please visit their respective websites. You may also be able to opt-out of interest-based advertising through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device, but your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt-out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising. If you opt out, you will still receive ads but they may not be as relevant to you and your interests, and your experience on our Services may be degraded. Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. VII. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California residents have additional privacy rights which are addressed in this Section VII. These rights apply solely to California residents and are in addition to the rights stated in this Privacy Policy. The CCPA does not apply to information regulated either by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), or the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), nor does it apply to covered entities, including providers of health care, and their business associates, who maintain patient information in accordance with those laws.

These third parties may use this information to display advertisements on our websites and elsewhere online tailored to your interests, preferences, and characteristics. Some of these third parties may participate in an industry organization that gives users the opportunity to opt out of receiving ads that are tailored based on your online activities.

You can add your verifiable digital vaccination record to the Health app by obtaining your vaccination record as a QR code or digital file from the administering entity or the immunization registry in the region where you received the vaccine. When you scan the QR code or tap the file, you will be given the option to open the record in the Health app. Your verifiable digital vaccination record may also be imported and stored in the Health app through the Health Records feature if you added an account with a participating healthcare organization. When you use a QR code or a download link to add your vaccination record to the Health app on iPhone, you can choose to add your vaccination record to Wallet, allowing you to quickly access your vaccination record from the Wallet app. When you add a vaccination card to Wallet, a copy of your vaccination record is stored by the Wallet app on the iOS device to which you added the vaccination card. The vaccination card stored in Wallet is not synced across your devices and not backed up to iCloud. The full details of your vaccination card will not be visible on the iPhone Lock Screen until you have authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode. To present your vaccination card details, you must first authenticate. Once authenticated, anyone with access to your device may be able to view your vaccination card when displayed on your device screen so you should take precautions to protect your device. You can remove your vaccination card from Wallet at any time. Removing your vaccination card from Wallet does not delete the copy of your vaccination record stored in the Health app. You can delete your vaccination record from the Health app at any time. Deletion of your vaccination record from the Health app will also delete the corresponding vaccination card from Wallet. Learn more about verifiable health records at support.apple.com/102467. Accessing Your Health Data Using Siri You can ask Siri to record certain health data types in the Health app, or to read your information available in the Health app. All processing of recognized Health app data requests by Siri occurs on device. If Siri does not recognize your request as a Health app data request, any health information you include in the request will be sent to the Siri server. You can turn off Siri’s access to your Health app data at any time by going to Settings > Apps > Health > Data Access & Devices > Siri, then tapping to turn off Access Health Data. Removing the Health App If you no longer want to use the Health app, you can choose to remove it from your iPhone or iPad by touching and holding the Health app on the Home Screen then tapping Remove App. When you delete the Health app on iPhone or iPad, your health data will remain on your device, and any apps or Health Sharing recipient you’ve shared health data with will continue to have access to existing health data you chose to share.

You can manage your health data, including deleting your health data and revoking permissions granted to third party apps and Health Sharing recipients, in the Settings app by going to Settings > Health. If you change your mind, you can redownload the Health app from the App Store.

Your Health app data will be stored in the Health app and in iCloud if you choose to back up your health data to iCloud, for as long you choose to store your information in the Health app. You can review, edit, and delete your Health app data at any time.

To the extent any data is considered protected health information (“PHI”) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Notice of Privacy Practices (“NPP”) of our associated provider groups will apply and supersede any conflicting practices set forth in this document. The applicable NPP is located here. In the United States, we provide two separate and distinct offerings. First, the ability to pay using your health insurance, when appropriate, if the BetterHelp providers are in-network with your health plan (""Insurance Offering""). Second, the ability to get a subscription package of services (""Subscription Offering""). If you are a member under our Insurance Offering (""Insurance Member""), the NPP applies to your PHI and, by using the Platform, you agree that you have read and accepted the NPP. This Privacy Policy will not be applicable to your PHI, which includes therapy data and other data after you login. Please refer to the NPP to understand how your PHI will be handled, your rights and how to exercise them with respect to PHI. If you are a member of our Subscription Offering (""Subscription Member""), then this Privacy Policy is the controlling document that outlines how we may use data associated with you, and the NPP does not apply. We may update this Privacy Policy. When we make significant changes to this Policy, we will notify you through our website or app when you log in to your account. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information. This document is broken into seven sections divided by topic.

The Profile Boost Program is an optional feature which shares the client-facing profile of BetterHelp Therapists with Google Search Ads and Directory partner websites, for the purpose of driving users to your profile and bringing you new clients. This Program is optional, and Therapists may opt-out at any time. Additional information about the Profile Boost Program, and the self-serve opt-out feature, is available on the Expertise and Preferences page of your Therapist Dashboard once you sign-up. The legal basis for processing the above data for Therapists on our Platform (or for the purposes of recruiting them) are legitimate interest, performance of a contract, and consent. In addition to processing, we also share some data with Service Providers12 in order for us to operate the Platform and to perform necessary website and application functions. Additionally, when you opt into sharing, we share certain data with Third Parties. For more information please see the section: ""What are the purposes for sharing my data?"" If you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons (previously &quot;Targeting cookies&quot;) some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy and/or PHI, may be shared for advertising purposes. To learn more, see section, ""Are you using my data for advertising?"". We process your IP address to determine your rough location so that we can personalize the platform for you. For example, we show you relevant information about our service that applies to visitors from your country. We also utilize your rough location to improve your user experience when using our platform. For example we auto populate your state (if applicable) and country when you are completing our onboarding questionnaire. We do not request or process exact location information such as information provided by your phone via GPS. We Process your address information when you provide it as part of your emergency contact information when you start therapy on the Platform. Your contact information is required to comply with therapy regulations and ethical code. It can be used, for example, in case your Therapist believes you are in immediate danger. When you are filing out this field, we may process your rough location to provide autocomplete suggestions for your convenience. Rough location using your IP address is also Processed by the ReCAPTCHA security API tool we use. ReCAPTCHA is a Service Provider we use to identify potentially malicious actors trying to access our site. Here is the ReCAPTCHA Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To learn about the additional purposes for which we Process IP addresses, please see: We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services. Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing. The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently. For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively. We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists. To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model. Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data: For Insurance Members: If you are an Insurance Member, your PHI will only be shared for the purposes outlined in the NPP in accordance with HIPAA. Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information. If you opt in to ""Analytics (previously ""Performance cookies"")"", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions. This analysis helps us to improve our products and services. If you opt in to ""Advertising (previously ""Targeting cookies"")"" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes. For more information about your specific settings, see here. To learn more, see section: ""Are you using my data for advertising?"" When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies. This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations. You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities. Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment. You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this. We aren't paid by anyone for any data. However, in California, the laws define ""sale"" broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value. If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a ""sale"" of personal information under that specific California law. For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents. In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps. In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal. Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy and PHI, may be shared for advertising purposes. As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites. If you use the App and have ""Allowed"" app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective. This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads. If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to ""Sharing Settings"" in the App and opt out of advertising. For IOS users, you can ""Ask App Not to Track"" when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking). From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app. Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in ""retargeting"" advertising. Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site. To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers. Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform. As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns. Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms. For additional information regarding Third Parties that may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List. For Insurance Members: If you are an Insurance Member, then please refer to the NPP. BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements. Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive or, under the Insurance Offering, you cease being an Insurance Member. These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information. Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function. In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data. The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access. In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See ""What is this Privacy Policy"") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone. BetterHelp's data retention policies are based upon what data is being Processed1, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity Did not start therapy Did not request data erasure Your data is retained for 3 years after your last login date and is then erased. Did start therapy Did not request data erasure Your data is retained for 10 years after your last login date and is then erased.

As stated, you have certain rights under data protection laws, including the right to request that we erase personal data we hold about you, and the right to request a copy of it. The following sections describe how you can exercise those rights. To request data erasure, please log in to your account and go to Menu > My Account (or Account Settings) > My Personal Information, where you will see a link to request complete erasure of your account. Click that and follow the instructions to begin the data erasure process. You will receive a confirmation email from us within 24 hours of your request. If you do not have access to your account or are having trouble with this method, you can directly contact Member Success at contact@betterhelp.com and they will assist you with the process. Additionally, if, under applicable data protection laws, you have the right to request that data we hold about you be edited or rectified, you may make this request by contacting Member Success. You can expect to receive an email confirming receipt of your request within 24 hours. Additionally you can visit our opt out instructions page to request erasure or to opt out of previous settings you have opted into. You may reach out to us at DPO@betterhelp.com if you need additional help. We will only comply with a request for the erasure of your data if we can verify your identity. There is usually no charge. In exceptional circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee after discussing the fee with you. If you reach out to either Member Success or DPO@betterhelp.com, we have specific requirements that must be met in order for us to process your data erasure request. In some circumstances, legal or regulatory requirements limit our ability to honor erasure requests. As such, we may decline requests for erasure if the information is: Additionally, compliance obligations require us to retain records documenting certain interactions you have with us related to your Membership. As such, we cannot honor erasure requests for information contained in records of: If we don't intend to comply with a request, then we will tell you why this is the case, and outline how we weighed your rights and freedoms against our legal obligations. In such instances, any information retained will only be used for purposes contemplated under the legally recognized exemption. To receive a summary copy of your data, please log in to your account and go to Menu > My Account (or Account settings) > My Personal information, where you will see an option to request a copy of your data. The data you will receive as part of this request includes the contact information that you input on the site, questionnaire answers, worksheet entries, emergency contact information, messages you sent to your Therapist, journal entries that you created, and other personal information. Additional data which we maintain includes email interactions with our help desk, which is stored on your email system. You may also request this information by writing to DPO@betterhelp.com. As with data erasure, we are not always able to respect your request for data access. For more information on why this may be and how the situation will be handled, please reference the previous section. Yes. We keep a limited log of the request, such as your contact details (such as your email address), the identity-verification documents you provided (if applicable), the steps we took to respond, and a copy of our response. We retain this information for 10 years for legitimate business or legal reasons, so that we can demonstrate compliance with US and international data protection laws and legal obligations, resolve any follow-up queries you may have, and defend legal claims. We automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization's relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed. (e.g., an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product). To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the ""Update Email Preferences"" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send. On that linked webpage, please check the box next to ""Delete my Data."" Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data. As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories. We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure. Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind. Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry. BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data. We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks. We have numerous robust security practices such as: For your own security, keep the following in mind: When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp under the Subscription Offering, we do not ask you for your full name. You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system. You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you. You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization's email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances. When you decide to start the therapy process, we'll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger. Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines. Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet. Read more about what data we Process1 and why here: If you're interested in further limiting what data is Processed, visit our opt-out instructions page to opt-out of tracking via cookies or web beacons, or for instructions on how to remove previously set cookies. You and your Therapist are able to see the messages you send, the worksheets you submit. Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries. A licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes. For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist's clinical care. In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account. Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded, unless you expressly consent. We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party. We don't knowingly collect or solicit any data or information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to become our users. The Platform is not directed at and not intended to be used by children under the age of thirteen (13). If you're aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen (13), please let us know by contacting us, and we'll delete that information.

Introduction Cerebral is committed to respecting the privacy of users of our services. To that end, this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of information Cerebral Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Cerebral,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) may collect, how we may use such information, and to whom we may disclose it in order to provide the services described below. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and use about you from our websites located at www.cerebral.com and www.getcerebral.com, any other U.S. websites on which we post this Privacy Policy, and the affiliated Cerebral mobile application (the “Platform”), and when you otherwise interact with us (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms of Use”). All capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. Except as provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by us outside of the Services, including on any other website operated by Cerebral or any other party, or data collected outside of the Services by Providers, the Medical Groups, the Labs, or the Pharmacies. It also does not apply to the information practices of any other party, including other parties you may communicate with off platform or other parties you connect with through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Services, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you use the Services on behalf of any other person, you represent that you are authorized to do so and that your use of the Services on such person’s behalf is acknowledged by that person. If any term in this Privacy Policy is unacceptable to you, do not use the Services. Continued use of the Services constitutes your express consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices, you may not use or otherwise access the Services. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates. Note: Cerebral operates the Platform but does not provide medical services and is not a medical group. Any telehealth consults obtained through our Services are provided by independent medical provider groups, including, but not limited to, Cerebral Medical Group, P.A. (collectively, the “Medical Groups”), which engage with a network of United States-based health care providers, including licensed therapists, nurse practitioners, and doctors (each, a “Provider”). The Medical Groups and all Providers are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information in accordance with federal and state law. The Medical Groups and their associated Providers process your health information in accordance with the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices. Where we process health information on behalf of the Medical Groups, we do so at the direction of such Medical Groups and in accordance with the policies set forth in their Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices. The Platform is owned and operated by Cerebral Inc. and/or its subsidiaries (collectively, “Cerebral”), and the Services (depending on your location at the time you receive Telehealth Services (as defined below)) are provided by Cerebral Medical Group, P.A. (Florida), Cerebral Medical Group P.C. (California), Cerebral Medical Group, P.C. (Alaska), Cerebral Medical Group, P.C. (Kansas), or Cerebral Medical Group, P.A. (New Jersey), Resilience Medical, P.C. (New Jersey), Resilience Psychotherapy LCSW P.C. (New York), or Resilience Medical, PC (California) (each, a “Medical Group”, and collectively, the “Medical Groups”). Cerebral does not own or have any ownership interest in the Medical Groups and the Medical Groups do not own or have any ownership interest in Cerebral. 2. Information We Collect and How We Collect It When you create an account with Cerebral, you are creating an express consumer relationship with us that enables you to access and/or utilize the various functions of the Services we provide. As part of that relationship, you provide information that we collect. As part of Services, you authorize Cerebral to, and we may collect the following information: 3. How We Use Your Information We may use the information we collect in the following ways: We may aggregate, de-identify, and/or anonymize any information collected through the Services so that such information is no longer reasonably capable of being associated with you. We may use aggregated or anonymized information for any permitted purpose, including for research and marketing analytics purposes, and we may also disclose such information for any permitted purpose to any other parties. 4. How We Disclose Your Information We may disclose your personal information under the following circumstances: 5. Your Data Choices Cookies and similar technologies. When you interact with the Services, we (and other parties that support our advertising efforts) may automatically collect certain information about your browser, device, and use of the Services through cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, local storage, and other similar technologies. Cookies are small text files stored on your browser or device, which allow us to provide certain features of the Services, personalize your user experience, and advertise our Services to you. You can find more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org. You may be able to set your browser to manage cookies and similar technologies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Because each browser is a little different, we encourage you to check your browser’s “Help” feature to learn how to manage cookies. For more information about managing cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Services may then be inaccessible or not function properly. Because we and Vendors we engage may use non-cookie technologies with your browser or device, browser settings that block cookies used in isolation may not affect the functioning of those technologies. Mobile devices often include settings to help you manage how your device collects and discloses information for advertising purposes. For more information on how to manage those devices’ settings, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s mobile choice page at www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice. Tailored advertising. We may engage other parties to serve tailored advertisements for our Services on our behalf on websites and applications operated by other parties. You have certain choices about how your information is used for this purpose. To learn more about tailored advertisements or to opt out of participating companies, see the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out program at www.aboutads.info/choices or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page at optout.networkadvertising.org. We make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of these opt-out mechanisms. You can opt out of Google Analytics through its currently available opt-outs for the web. Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to see ads, but they may not be based on your interests. In addition, these other parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You may also opt out of such advertising cookies and tracking technologies by following the directions here: Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information. Marketing communications. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can check certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data or under your User Account page and/or follow the instructions in our marketing emails. You may also send us a return email asking to be omitted from future email distributions. Regardless of your indicated email preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding the Services, including, for example, notices of updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, appointment reminders, and other information related to your User Account. SMS communications. You can opt out of SMS communications as described in our Terms of Use. Location information. You can choose whether to allow our Services to collect real-time information about your device’s location through the device’s privacy settings. If you do not authorize us to collect location information, some parts of our Services may be inaccessible or not function properly. Social media and other Third-Party Accounts. To control the information you disclose to us when you follow us, like our posts, or otherwise interact with us on social media, you can adjust your social media account settings related to how your information is disclosed. If you access the Services or create a User Account through a Third-Party Account, please consult the settings in the applicable Third-Party Account to control how the provider of the Third-Party Account discloses information to us. Push notifications. If your device is configured to receive push notifications, we may send you push notifications. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off through your device settings. Other choices. You can review and change certain data processing preferences at any time by choosing 'Sharing Settings' on the homepage or after logging into your account. Depending on your jurisdiction of residence, you may have certain rights to access, delete, or correct your information. Your rights will be subject to applicable exceptions, and we will need to verify your identity before processing your request. If you would like to submit a request relating to your data, please email us at privacy@getcerebral.com. Please note that if you delete your User Account, medical providers, including Providers, and other affiliates may still have the right to retain information under applicable law, regulations, or their own retention policy. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. 6. Protected Health Information When you set up a User Account with Cerebral, you are creating a direct customer relationship with Cerebral that enables you to access and/or utilize the Services. As part of that relationship, you provide information to Cerebral, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, shipping address, phone number, and certain transactional information that is not “protected health information” or “medical information.” However, in using certain components of the Services, some of the information we collect may constitute “protected health information” (“PHI”) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). While Cerebral is not a “covered entity” as defined in HIPAA, one or more of the Medical Groups and its Providers, the Pharmacies, the Labs, and/or other health care providers engaging with you through our Services may be a “covered entity” or “business associate” under HIPAA and therefore subject to HIPAA, and Cerebral may in some cases be a “business associate” of a Medical Group, Pharmacy, and/or Lab. Please note that HIPAA does not necessarily apply to an entity or person simply because there is health information involved, and HIPAA may not apply to your transactions or communications with Cerebral, the Medical Groups, the Providers, the Pharmacies, and/or the Labs. To the extent Cerebral is deemed a “business associate,” however, and solely in its role as a business associate, Cerebral may be subject to certain provisions of HIPAA with respect to PHI. In addition, any medical or health information you provide that is subject to specific protections under applicable state laws (collectively, with PHI, “Protected Information”), will be used and disclosed in accordance with such applicable laws. However, any information that does not constitute Protected Information under applicable laws may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy. Protected Information does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance with applicable laws. The Medical Groups and their affiliated Providers have adopted a Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices that describes how they use and disclose PHI. By accessing or using the Services to interact with a Medical Group and/or Provider, you acknowledge that you have received and agreed to the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices from your Medical Group and/or Provider(s). Where Cerebral collects, uses, and discloses Protected Information on behalf of your Medical Group or Provider, such processing on behalf of your Medical Group or Provider shall be consistent with the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices and as permitted in Cerebral’s agreements with the Medical Groups or Providers, except to the extent you have expressly authorized additional uses and disclosures. We may use PHI for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations, including to communicate with you, to provide requested services, to provide information to your Medical Groups or Providers, pharmacies, and insurers, to obtain payments for our services, and to communicate with your Medical Groups or Providers, pharmacies, and benefits program. We may combine your PHI with other information about you, including information from other sources, such as from your Medical Groups or Providers, pharmacies, insurers, or benefits program, to maintain an accurate record of our users. We may use your PHI to contact you for any services or products offered by Cerebral or the Medical Groups. 7. Data Retention Generally, we keep your information no longer than the period necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as necessary for our legitimate business interests, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Generally speaking, in most cases, patient information is retained based on state law requirements. For further information on how long we retain other types of information, please email support@cerebral.com. 8. Data Security We have implemented measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We use encryption technology for information sent and received by us. However, transmitting information via the Internet is not completely secure, so although we take steps to protect your information, we cannot guarantee complete security. You disclose information to us at your own risk. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and to not share it with anyone. 9. Links and Offerings from Other Parties This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the practices or policies of any other parties using, accessible through, or linked from, the Services, including the providers, the Medical Groups, the Pharmacies, the Labs, the manufacturer of your mobile device and other IT hardware or software, and any app or website operated by another party to which our Services may contain a link. These other parties may gather information from or about you. We have no control over the privacy practices of these other parties and make no representations about them. We encourage you to review the Medical Group Notice of Privacy Practices and the privacy policies of each website and application you visit and use. 10. Minors’ Information Our Services are not directed to children aged 6-17 without parental or legal guardian, consent based on applicable state law requirements. We do not knowingly collect information for individuals under the age of 18 (including, for children under the age of thirteen, “personal information” as defined in the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) without the verifiable consent of that child’s parent or guardian. If we learn that we have received any information for an individual without proper consent, we process and delete that information as required by applicable law. If you are aware of a child providing personal information to us without parental or guardian consent, please contact us using privacy@cerebral.com 11. U.S. Residents If you are a U.S. resident, you may have certain additional privacy rights. 12. UK, EU, & EMEA Residents If you are a resident of the Middle East, EU, or UK, you may have certain additional privacy rights. 13. Revisions to Our Privacy Policy We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page. The date this Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically monitoring and reviewing any updates to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Services after such amendments will be deemed your acknowledgment of and agreement to any changes to this Privacy Policy. 14.

This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with your personally identifiable information (such as by registering for a User Account for the Services or sending an e-mail to Wachanga), Wachanga will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information when you browse the Website. When you use the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, Wachanga or trusted third parties authorized by Wachanga may collect certain technical and routing information about your computer (also known as environmental variables). When you browse the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits information to Wachanga each time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular web page you visited, your computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address, and your Internet browser version. We collect this information in order to make the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services function properly and provide you the Website’s functionality. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services and how we can better adjust the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, their contents, and functionality to meet the needs of our users. However, this information is not associated with any personally identifiable information. Providing Information to Wachanga You never have to provide personally identifiable information to Wachanga. However, should you choose to withhold certain required information, Wachanga may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Services. For instance, a User Account is necessary to enjoy all of the Wachanga Services features. Some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory or optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, you may not be able to engage in that activity. Wachanga will inform you of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required information. When you submit personal identifiable information to Wachanga through the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across international boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Wachanga and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices or web hosting servers. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Wachanga. Such vendors are contractually bound not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. Wachanga may establish relationships with various partners whose services may become available to you via the Website, Wachanga Apps, or Services, or third party websites. Typically, these partners will offer services that Wachanga users may find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services. In order to use these third-party services, you may be required to provide personal information to the partner providing the services. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide a Wachanga partner will be subject to the privacy policy posted on that partner’s website, and personal information that you provide while using the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services in conjunction with a partner’s service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. For instance, credit card or PayPal® information entered as part of the filling out a purchase form or registration process collected by a third party’s registration and/or merchant services is subject to the third party’s privacy policy. You should be aware that Wachanga’s agreements with its partners often provide that they will share with Wachanga personally identifiable information collected from you. In such instances, Wachanga may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. The partners may also use User Content in connection with commercial, sponsored, or related content, within the Website, or Services (such use referred to as “Sponsored Content”). If your User Content (including your name, username, profile picture, content, photograph, or other likenesses) is used on the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services for purposes of Sponsored Content, Wachanga will notify you of this use and provide you the option to “opt-out” of having your User Content used in this way. Also, you may choose to prevent all future use of your User Content for purposes of Sponsored Content within the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services. If you are under the age of eighteen (18) or under any other legal age of majority, you represent that at least one of your parents or legal guardians has also agreed to the terms of this section (and the use of your name, username, profile picture, content, photograph, or other likenesses) on your behalf. Parents or legal guardians of minor children whose User Content appears in Wachanga’s Sponsored Content may choose to “opt-out” and prevent all future use of a minor’s User Content in this way. If you are unsure whether your User Content has been used as part of Wachanga’s Sponsored Content and would like to find out, please contact us at team@wachanga.com. Wachanga will need to verify your identity before responding to any requests so please be prepared to provide certain information such as your username, password, or other information as requested by Wachanga. Wachanga also reserves the right to use User Content in connection with its commercial activities within the Website, Wachanga App or Services, and to offer you additional Services either for a fee or without. If your User Content (including your name, username, profile picture, content, photograph, or other likenesses) is used by us in this manner, Wachanga will notify you of this use and provide you the option to “opt-out” of having your User Content used in this way. Email Communications You may be provided an opportunity to subscribe to periodic newsletters from Wachanga or product updates from Wachanga’s advertisers. The newsletters and product updates are marketing tools that allow Wachanga and its advertisers to inform you of services, products, and updates, as well as other news that may be relevant to you. Subscription may require you to provide your first and last name, your email address, and other information. You will be given the opportunity to choose the type of information Wachanga or its advertisers provide to you and you can opt-out from receiving updates by unsubscribing via the “Unsubscribe” link contained in the email or by either making the corresponding selection in your User Account or by request at team@wachanga.com. Opting-out of these emails will not end the transmission of important service-related emails that are necessary to your use of the App. In order to provide communication services, we engage third-party service providers to carry out such newsletter services, surveys or notifications campaigns. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to the Company by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them to the Company in an email.User Account Wachanga encourages all of its users to sign up for User Accounts in order to access the full range of features offered by the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services.

Such information may include your name, e-mail, gender, age group, and other personally identifiable information. Additionally, you may log into the Services using an authorized third party social network account, such as a Facebook, Twitter, Google + or Instagram account. In the event that you log into the Services using a third party social network account, Wachanga may collect certain information from your third party social network account profile as well as information regarding your activities on the third party social network. It is completely optional for you to register for a User Account or engage in activities requiring a User Account. Once you create a User Account, you will be deemed a Registered User and will be able to access, review and update your User Account information through the Services. You may also request to access and change your personal information and privacy preferences by contacting us at team@wachanga.com. If you wish to deactivate your User Account, you can do so by selecting the corresponding option in your User Account or contacting Wachanga at team@wachanga.com. When you deactivate your User Account, some or all of the information stored and maintained as part of your account may be retained on our servers, including the User Content uploaded via the Services. Third Party Websites and Mobile Apps The Website, Wachanga Apps and Services may contain links to websites and mobile apps (“third-party services”) owned and operated by third parties. Such links are presented for your convenience and information. Wachanga does not control these third-party services and is not responsible for their privacy practices or content. Wachanga does not control the information collection and distribution policies on such services other than those that are under the control of Wachanga itself. Content on third-party services may not reflect products, services, and/or information provided by Wachanga. Third parties may also set their own cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had to contact these third parties. Wachanga does not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. You should direct all concerns regarding any third party service to the site administrator or webmaster of such service. In addition to Wachanga’s own advertising on the Website, Wachanga Apps, or Services, Wachanga also uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website, use Wachanga Apps or Services. These companies may use general information about your visits to the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services as well as other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices as to not having your information used by these companies, please direct such concerns to the respective company’s administrator or webmaster.Third Party Applications Wachanga may make third-party applications available to you through the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services. The information collected by Wachanga when you enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by the provider’s privacy policies. Information Relating to Children The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/. The Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services. The collection of information from such users is covered above. Parents and legal guardians may request that we review, delete, or stop the collection of personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so by contacting us at to team@wachanga.com. If you are aware of anyone under 13 using the Wachanga Services, please contact us at team@wachanga.com and we will take required steps to delete such information and (or) delete their account. Age limitation for EU residents. Due to requirements of the GDPR, you shall be at least 16 years old in order to use the App. To the extent prohibited by applicable law, we do not allow use of the App by the EU residents younger than 16 years old. If you are aware of anyone younger than 16 using the App, please contact us at team@wachanga.com and we will take steps to delete such information and (or) delete their account.Cookies and Web Beacons The Website uses “cookie” and “web beacon” technology. “Cookies” are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a user’s computer. Certain pages on our Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple pages together. Cookies also enable us to customize our Website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with us. In addition, cookies are used to: • measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information; more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; • identify and categorized the internet webpages from which the visitor came to the Website and observe the browsing patterns; and • provide functionality such as online orders, Wachanga services and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you. The types of cookies that we use are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Wachanga. Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files. In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our e-mails use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed and whether the site was accessed from an advertisement. There are no cookies in advertisements or e-mails. The cookie generated from the advertisement or e-mail does not contain any personally identifiable information and will remain on your hard drive until you delete it. You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our Website. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. The use of web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. Wachanga uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. Wachanga may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.B. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION How Your Personal Information Is Used Wachanga collects information from you in order to record and support your participation in the activities provided by Wachanga. We may use your e-mail address to send a confirmation e-mail when you sign up for a User Account and, if necessary, may use other information you provide to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected. Your personal information also may be used to keep you informed about new services, service upgrades, special offers, and other Services. We may use your information, including your Personal Data, for the following purposes: - to verify your identity; - to personalize your experience when you use our Services. You can personalize your experience by adding health data into your profile, completing assessments, or using other services we offer. We will use this data to personalize Services, track your symptoms, assess your health, and display articles of interest to you; - to send you information about our Services, health tips, technical notices, support messages, confirmations, and reminders; - to analyze, operate, maintain and improve the App, to add new features and services to the App; - for billing (invoicing), account management and other administrative purposes, if applies; - to respond to your comments, questions, and requests and provide customer service; - to monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our App; - solely with respect to information that you mark for sharing, for Company promotional purposes (except data from Apple HealthKit and Google Fit); - to link or combine with information we get from others (except data from Apple HealthKit, Core Motion Framework, and Google Fit) or (and) from you to help understand your needs and provide you with better service (to use in the training of neural networks, artificial intelligence, as well as for any other automated decision-making processing); - for scientific and academic research purposes; and - for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time, we collect Personal Data or any other purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy. As described above, Wachanga may collect information about your use of the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services (such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily). Wachanga recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected through the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services. Wachanga reserves that right to communicate with you regarding products, services, or special offers available from Wachanga or its affiliates. Wachanga will provide you the option to “opt-out” of having being contacted in this way. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Wachanga will not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.Disclosure of Information to Third Parties In operating the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services, Wachanga may engage third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Wachanga. These parties are contractually prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Wachanga specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Wachanga’s affiliates for their use without your approval. In the event that all or substantially all of Wachanga’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Wachanga may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner than as described herein, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.Disclosure of Information to Other Users Through the use of the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services, you may have the option to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself to other users.

Please exercise due caution when engaging in any such communication.Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information Wachanga is committed to protecting the security of your personally identifiable information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information. Wachanga operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Wachanga takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk. We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company’s security procedures and corporate policies regarding the protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Wachanga, it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Wachanga. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where Wachanga and its service providers conduct business. All Wachanga employees are obligated by our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who perform technical support of the service. A password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving any site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.Your rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation you have a number of important rights free of charge. In summary, those include rights to: - access to your personal data and to certain other supplementary information that this Privacy Notice is already designed to address; - require Us to correct any mistakes in your information which We hold; - require the erasure of personal data concerning you in certain situations; - receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to Us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to a third party in certain situations; - object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for direct marketing; - object to decisions being taken by automated means which produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you; - object in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal data; - otherwise restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances; - claim compensation for damages caused by our breach of any data protection laws. For further information on each of those rights, including the circumstances in which they apply, see the Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on individuals rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please: - contact us using our Contact details below, - contact us using our Contact details below, - let Us have enough information to identify you, - let Us have proof of your identity and address, and - let Us know the information to which your request relates.CHOICES AVAILABLE TO YOU You may always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Services. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold certain requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the Services dependent upon the collection of this information. You will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisites for our rendering such services. You can choose at any time to opt-out of receiving e-mails from Wachanga by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email you receive from Wachanga or by contacting Wachanga directly at team@wachanga.com. If you elect to opt-out, we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law. We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation e-mail, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements. Wachanga is retaining this right because in limited cases we feel that we may need to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. This does not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. When you create a User Account with Wachanga and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to Wachanga offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Wachanga has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We may use a third-party e-mail service provider to send e-mails to you. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send Wachanga related e-mail. If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to team@wachanga.com. In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail. You may also opt-out online by updating your User Account as described in the User Account section of this Privacy Policy (above). To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Wachanga with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to Wachanga when you requested services or products. Wachanga reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.C. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS Wachanga takes and addresses its users’ privacy concerns with utmost respect and attention. If you believe that there was an instance of non-compliance with this Privacy Policy with regard to your personal information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write or contact Wachanga at team@wachanga.com. In your message, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly. Please note that if you provide Wachanga with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that they may not), Wachanga cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be honored.D.

The Clue app gives people the ability to understand what is going on inside of their bodies and minds based on individual tracked health data, providing self-insight and self-advocacy that’s powered by data processing.We also fully acknowledge the responsibility that comes with being the safekeepers of so much intimate data which is tracked by people using Clue. Which is why we are always striving to achieve the highest standards of privacy and security. Keeping your data safe is at the core of everything we do.We see it as our job to be clear and transparent so that you can truly understand what we do with your data, even though the digital ecosystem of an app is complex. To provide our service as a health app, we rely on a number of other providers as summarized below to help us. Please read the whole of this Privacy Policy to understand how we handle your data. We have done our best to make it as clear and comprehensible as possible.

Upon receiving this information, Clue will then activate your Clue Plus subscription. Clue shares with Wellhub whether you have been active in the Clue app. This is done by sending an event called ‘Create Record’ to Wellhub. At no point does Wellhub ever receive any of your tracked health data. Legal basis: Our legal basis for processing the above mentioned data is Art. 6 b) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which means that we use it to perform the contract that you have entered into with Clue, via Wellhub. We also process your Clue account data and usage data on the legal basis of Art 6 Sec.1 lit b) GDPR to provide our services to you. The processing of health data to provide our service to you is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR: I agree to Clue processing the health data I choose to share with the app, so they can provide their service.

Providing this service is part of our paid Clue Plus subscription. If you use this service, Clue will have to access and process your personal data, including your health data depending on the nature of your query. We do this so we can adequately provide you support with your request.Third party providers: To provide customer support and communicate with you, Clue uses services from Slack Technologies Ltd (“Slack”), based in Ireland, and Zendesk, Inc. (“Zendesk”), based in the United States. We also use Growthdot, a company based in Ukraine, to anonymise customer support communications at the end of the retention period. Whenever data is transferred to providers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Legal basis:The legal basis for processing your account data and usage data for customer service is Art 6 Sec. 1 lit b) GDPR, and Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR for your health data.

All personal data collected for our customer service is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.3 To help advance scientific research To help advance menstrual and reproductive health studies, we share relevant de-identified health data you’ve tracked in the Clue app with carefully selected research partners to be used in their scientific studies. When you track in Clue, your data becomes something powerful. It can help answer questions to better understand menstrual and reproductive health. Women and people with cycles are still widely underrepresented in health research. We believe that the data tracked in Clue can change this. By teaming up with our trusted research partners we can advance research, break harmful taboos and lay the groundwork for better healthcare. We only share data that is directly relevant to the research question and follow strict protocols to ensure your data always remains anonymous to the researchers. We use a de-identification technique which means all personal identifiers like your name and email address are erased. Your dataset is then assigned a random ID, making sure you can’t be identified by the researchers. If you are a participant in a scientific study that is run by a research facility using Clue as a tool to collect information for that study, then Clue will share your personal information with the research facility only under the terms of your consent as given to that research facility. When you use Clue as part of a scientific study, we will otherwise treat your personal data with the same care as we do all user data. The research facility will be solely responsible for the usage of your personal data, including health data, in the context of their scientific study. We consider that Clue and our partnered research facilities have joint responsibility (""joint controllership"" under GDPR) in this case. Research partners: We team up with carefully selected research partners both in and outside of the European Union. You can read more about the type of research partnerships we have here. Whenever data is transferred to partners outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Legal basis: The processing of your health data for scientific research is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to the health data I track in the app being de-identified and shared with carefully selected research partners in and outside of the European Union to advance menstrual and reproductive health studies. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for scientific research is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.4 To improve Clue features with health analytics To help us build more valuable features in Clue, we process health data you’ve tracked in the app to better understand which features are most useful to you. By processing data such as period dates and cycle experiences, we can better understand how our community uses the app and further tailor the experience to fit their needs. By analyzing how our community uses the app, we can understand which features are most valuable. We use these insights to drive feature development, so we can make sure to deliver what’s most important. This could include things like improving the accuracy of predictions, building new algorithms to offer you more health insights, or creating content about topics we see our community wants to read about more. The processing of health data for analytics purposes is managed internally by Clue. We store your data on servers in the EU and it’s always de-identified, removing personal identifiers like your name and email address. These procedures ensure your privacy. Third party providers: We do not use any third party providers for this purpose. Legal basis: The processing of your health data for health analytics is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to the health data I track in the app being processed for analytics purposes so Clue can improve my predictions, develop new algorithms and create more valuable features with personalized insights. You can toggle this off at any time.

This includes usage data like your device ID and IP address. By improving the app and its technical platform, we can deliver a better experience for you and the wider Clue community. It allows us to tailor the app to different types of devices, and most importantly, strive to make the app experience the best it can be. Third party providers: We do not use any third party providers for this purpose. Legal basis: We process your usage data on the legal basis of Art 6 Sec.1 lit f) GDPR to technically improve the Clue app based on Clue’s legitimate interest as a company to continuously improve the app and deliver an improved service to you. We do not believe there is anything you could have against this. However you can always opt out of this data processing at any time in your Clue app’s privacy settings by toggling off: As outlined in Clue’s Privacy Policy and based on Clue’s legitimate interest as a company to continuously improve the app, certain usage and technical data is processed. I have the right to opt out of this at any time. All personal data collected to technically improve the Clue app is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.6 To allow recommendations from Clue To make personalized recommendations, we process certain usage data to understand how you interact with the Clue app, as well as the health data you’ve tracked to deliver you more personalized insights. This includes data such as your period dates and cycle experiences. We also collect your account data so we can then send you these recommendations via in-app messages, emails, and push notifications (if you’ve enabled permissions on your device). By personalizing your experience, we can provide information that’s more tailored to you and your needs. This might look like sending you updates about new Clue features based on what you’ve tracked, or suggesting interesting products from partnerships we support that may be relevant to you. For example, if you’re trying to conceive, we might recommend services that can support you on your conception journey. We strive to be mindful about what we communicate and how often, as providing you with the most comfortable experience possible is our main priority. Third party providers: We use certain third party software providers to help us send these updates, such as Braze (see Section 3.1.1). These providers are not permitted to use the data for any other purpose other than to help Clue personalize your experience. Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Be assured that the sensitive health data you track in the Clue app is never shared with or sold to advertisers, or any partners whose services we may recommend in Clue. Legal basis: The processing of your account data and usage data for recommendations from Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR, and the processing of health data for recommendation from Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to my account data, usage data and health data I track in the Clue app being processed so Clue can send me personal recommendations for relevant products based on my tracked experiences. Certain third-party providers, including some located outside of the European Union, are used to help with this. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for providing personal recommendations is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.7 To help Clue optimize their advertising efforts To help us analyze how Clue’s advertising performs, we process certain types of usage data (for example when you install the Clue app or subscribe to Clue Plus) and technical data including your device ID and IP address. This helps us identify whether you’ve already downloaded Clue or have a Clue Plus subscription, and find out which Clue ads you interacted with (if any). By doing this, we can optimize our advertising efforts. For example, if you’ve already downloaded the Clue app, we won’t show you an ad to download Clue. It also helps us understand on which platforms people find out about us, and learn what kind of Clue advertising performs best. With better advertising, we can help raise awareness about the Clue app and empower more people to take charge of their health. Third party providers: We use certain third party services to help us with our advertising efforts. These include Apple Search Ads and Google Ads, both based in the United States, and Adjust and Taboola (described in more detail below). Adjust: Clue uses services operated by Adjust, a company based in Germany, to measure and improve campaign performance through attribution and analytics. They help us understand where our users are coming from, which age group they are from, and how they are interacting with our app, so that we can optimize our ad campaigns. Adjust uses your advertising identifier (Apple IDFA on iOS, Google Play Services ID on Android), and your IP addresses to provide us these insights. Through Adjust, we share standard app events like installation of the Clue app or subscription to Clue Plus services with certain advertisement networks like Meta and Tiktok. We do this to avoid showing you Clue ads if you’ve already downloaded or are subscribed to Clue Plus. Adjust does not have access to any of the personal health data you track in the app, and therefore cannot share this sensitive information with any advertisement networks the platform corresponds with. Adjust does not have access to any of the personal health data you track in the app. You can read more about how Adjust handles data in their Privacy PolicyTaboola: Clue uses an advertising service by Taboola, a company based in Germany. They allow us to find new users through their ad platform and optimize our advertising efforts by better understanding where our users come from. With their service, we can identify if users visited specific Clue website landing pages via Clue advertisements hosted by Taboola. This is done by adding a Taboola pixel to our Clue landing pages, and Taboola placing cookies on our website (see Section 7.2). The pixel is a small file that saves information about the visiting user’s device, operating system, and IP address. This is done only if the person agreed to our website’s analytical cookies. The data is pseudonymized in this process. You can read more about how Taboola handles data in their Privacy Policy.Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Be assured that the sensitive health data you track in the Clue app is never shared with or sold to advertisers.

All personal data collected to help to promote Clue is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.8 To optimize advertising with activity tracking (iOS users only) To help us optimize our advertising and to spread the word about Clue, we enable activity tracking on iOS devices when permissions are turned on. Activity tracking means that limited technical data (like your device ID) and usage data (for example installing Clue or subscribing to Clue Plus) is shared with advertisers so you don’t see Clue ads that aren’t relevant to you. You can turn off activity tracking any time in your iOS Settings.Activity tracking is strictly limited to technical and usage data. Your health data is never shared with advertisers and always protected. Legal basis: The processing of your usage data for activity tracking is based on the following consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR, if you selected “Allow” when presented the following prompt from Apple: Allow “Clue” to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites? All personal data collected for activity tracking is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.9 To optimize our advertising efforts and to improve helloclue.com with website analytics To optimize our advertising efforts and to improve our website, we process usage data such as your IP address and device data.

This may include your name and email address, which is needed to send you the newsletters you’ve subscribed to. If you’re a Clue app user with an account, Clue will process the email address you provided with your account registration to send you the newsletters you’ve subscribed to, as well as occasional emails with promotional content.

Any information given by you via such surveys is processed by Clue for the purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Third party providers: Clue uses easyfeedback GmbH “Easyfeedback"", a survey tool provider based in Germany, to run surveys and process results. They may process data from surveys you choose to participate in for science research, user experience research, or customer satisfaction research. In case personal data is processed for a survey, you will be asked for an explicit consent. Your Clue app data is never shared with Easyfeedback. Clue also uses UserTesting, a provider located in the United States, for conducting user experience studies. If you’re invited to sign up to a study pool via a Clue survey, you’ll be taken to the UserTesting website and be asked to provide your name and email to enter the pool. The selection of participants is carried out by UserTesting, therefore, we cannot guarantee that you will be invited to participate in a further study or interview. Legal basis: The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in a survey is your consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR. In case health data is involved, the legal basis is Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR.

Data transfer outside the European Union Any personal data collected from you may only be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if we observe applicable privacy regulations and ensure that your privacy rights remain protected. To ensure an adequate level of data protection in accordance with Art 46 GDPR, we have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with all non-EEA third parties whose data processing tools we use (data processors) if there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for their particular country. For U.S. based data processing, we also use third-party providers that are certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework as a guarantee under Art 46 GDPR. You can read more about the Standard Contractual Clauses here. The Standard Contractual Clauses help us to implement an adequate level of data protection between Clue and our processors, who must agree to follow strict data protection rules. However, they do not bind the governmental bodies of the non-EEA country in which our processor operates. In some cases, governments may have powers of surveillance that run contrary to EU law data protection principles. We choose our processors very carefully. We do not work with processors based in countries where we are concerned about the rule of law with respect to privacy. We follow the guidance of the European Data Protection Board on additional contractual and technical measures to ensure a sufficient level of privacy in different situations. 5.

Request the complete deletion of your data, including all past data sent to third-party services used for tracking and analysis, by reaching out to <trust@helloclue.com>. Your data will be deleted within 1 month.vi. Lodge a complaint with the relevant supervising authority if you believe Clue is processing your personal data in violation of applicable data protection regulations. 6. Data security procedures Protecting your data privacy is at the core of what we do. We apply security measures to protect against misuse, loss, and/or alteration of personal information under our control. We follow industry standards when transferring and storing your data. Though we cannot ensure or guarantee that misuse, loss or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. 6.1 How Clue secures your personal data When you create an account with Clue, your personal profile data is stored separately from your health data and your service settings. Doing this means your health data has an even higher level of protection. Clue uses servers located in the European Union to process and store your personal data. When you create your Clue password, it’s stored using one-way encryption with both “hashing” and “salting” techniques. This means your password is combined with a random string of characters and then scrambled up so it's unreadable. Not even Clue staff have access to your password. Doing this ensures extra protection for your password. Note that if you use social login to create your account (see Section 3.1.3), Clue does not receive your original password. When your data is sent between your device and our Clue servers, we use hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). This is a type of encrypted data transmission, which scrambles the information being sent so it’s unreadable. Doing this increases the security of your data transfer. HTTPS is the same technology used to create secure connections for your web browser and is indicated by a padlock icon in the URL bar of your browser. When you subscribe to Clue Plus, all your payment information is securely processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Clue does not store your payment information at any time. 6.2 Clue’s recommendations for protecting your data Usually, the biggest threat to the security and privacy of your data is that someone—probably someone you know—gains access to any of your devices without your consent. The data you enter into Clue is private and it should stay that way. If you actively choose to share your data, for example if you are using Clue Connect, make sure to regularly review whether it still makes sense for you to share that information with your connections. Here are some tips on how to keep your devices secure: Protect your Clue account: Make sure to create a unique long password for your Clue account. We recommend using a password manager for this purpose. Protect your device:i. Activate either passcode, TouchID, or FaceID authentication for your device. This automatically secures your Clue data and prevents any person from using your device without your permission. ii. Set up a feature that will allow you to erase all the data from your device if it’s been lost or stolen. For iOS, activating this feature is a two-step process. First, activate “Find My iPhone” (instructions here) and then enable “Erase your device” (instructions here). For Android, set up Find My Device and, if needed, use the connected web interface to lock or wipe your phone remotely. 7.

How Clue values data privacy At Clue, we believe that technology and data present a groundbreaking opportunity to empower people to take control of their health. The Clue app gives people the ability to understand what is going on inside of their bodies and minds based on individual tracked health data, providing self-insight and self-advocacy that’s powered by data processing.We also fully acknowledge the responsibility that comes with being the safekeepers of so much intimate data which is tracked by people using Clue.

Upon receiving this information, Clue will then activate your Clue Plus subscription. Clue shares with Wellhub whether you have been active in the Clue app. This is done by sending an event called ‘Create Record’ to Wellhub. At no point does Wellhub ever receive any of your tracked health data. Legal basis: Our legal basis for processing the above mentioned data is Art. 6 b) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which means that we use it to perform the contract that you have entered into with Clue, via Wellhub. We also process your Clue account data and usage data on the legal basis of Art 6 Sec.1 lit b) GDPR to provide our services to you. The processing of health data to provide our service to you is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR: I agree to Clue processing the health data I choose to share with the app, so they can provide their service. All personal data collected for providing our service is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected.3.1.5.

All personal data collected for our customer service is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.3 To help advance scientific research To help advance menstrual and reproductive health studies, we share relevant de-identified health data you’ve tracked in the Clue app with carefully selected research partners to be used in their scientific studies. When you track in Clue, your data becomes something powerful. It can help answer questions to better understand menstrual and reproductive health. Women and people with cycles are still widely underrepresented in health research. We believe that the data tracked in Clue can change this. By teaming up with our trusted research partners we can advance research, break harmful taboos and lay the groundwork for better healthcare. We only share data that is directly relevant to the research question and follow strict protocols to ensure your data always remains anonymous to the researchers. We use a de-identification technique which means all personal identifiers like your name and email address are erased. Your dataset is then assigned a random ID, making sure you can’t be identified by the researchers. If you are a participant in a scientific study that is run by a research facility using Clue as a tool to collect information for that study, then Clue will share your personal information with the research facility only under the terms of your consent as given to that research facility. When you use Clue as part of a scientific study, we will otherwise treat your personal data with the same care as we do all user data. The research facility will be solely responsible for the usage of your personal data, including health data, in the context of their scientific study. We consider that Clue and our partnered research facilities have joint responsibility (""joint controllership"" under GDPR) in this case. Research partners: We team up with carefully selected research partners both in and outside of the European Union. You can read more about the type of research partnerships we have here. Whenever data is transferred to partners outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Legal basis: The processing of your health data for scientific research is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to the health data I track in the app being de-identified and shared with carefully selected research partners in and outside of the European Union to advance menstrual and reproductive health studies. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for scientific research is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.4 To improve Clue features with health analytics To help us build more valuable features in Clue, we process health data you’ve tracked in the app to better understand which features are most useful to you. By processing data such as period dates and cycle experiences, we can better understand how our community uses the app and further tailor the experience to fit their needs. By analyzing how our community uses the app, we can understand which features are most valuable. We use these insights to drive feature development, so we can make sure to deliver what’s most important. This could include things like improving the accuracy of predictions, building new algorithms to offer you more health insights, or creating content about topics we see our community wants to read about more. The processing of health data for analytics purposes is managed internally by Clue. We store your data on servers in the EU and it’s always de-identified, removing personal identifiers like your name and email address. These procedures ensure your privacy. Third party providers: We do not use any third party providers for this purpose. Legal basis: The processing of your health data for health analytics is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to the health data I track in the app being processed for analytics purposes so Clue can improve my predictions, develop new algorithms and create more valuable features with personalized insights. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for the health data analytics is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.5 To technically improve the Clue app To help us improve the Clue app experience, we process and analyze certain data so we can improve the app and make features easier to use. This includes usage data like your device ID and IP address. By improving the app and its technical platform, we can deliver a better experience for you and the wider Clue community. It allows us to tailor the app to different types of devices, and most importantly, strive to make the app experience the best it can be. Third party providers: We do not use any third party providers for this purpose. Legal basis: We process your usage data on the legal basis of Art 6 Sec.1 lit f) GDPR to technically improve the Clue app based on Clue’s legitimate interest as a company to continuously improve the app and deliver an improved service to you. We do not believe there is anything you could have against this. However you can always opt out of this data processing at any time in your Clue app’s privacy settings by toggling off: As outlined in Clue’s Privacy Policy and based on Clue’s legitimate interest as a company to continuously improve the app, certain usage and technical data is processed. I have the right to opt out of this at any time. All personal data collected to technically improve the Clue app is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.6 To allow recommendations from Clue To make personalized recommendations, we process certain usage data to understand how you interact with the Clue app, as well as the health data you’ve tracked to deliver you more personalized insights. This includes data such as your period dates and cycle experiences. We also collect your account data so we can then send you these recommendations via in-app messages, emails, and push notifications (if you’ve enabled permissions on your device). By personalizing your experience, we can provide information that’s more tailored to you and your needs. This might look like sending you updates about new Clue features based on what you’ve tracked, or suggesting interesting products from partnerships we support that may be relevant to you. For example, if you’re trying to conceive, we might recommend services that can support you on your conception journey. We strive to be mindful about what we communicate and how often, as providing you with the most comfortable experience possible is our main priority. Third party providers: We use certain third party software providers to help us send these updates, such as Braze (see Section 3.1.1). These providers are not permitted to use the data for any other purpose other than to help Clue personalize your experience. Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Be assured that the sensitive health data you track in the Clue app is never shared with or sold to advertisers, or any partners whose services we may recommend in Clue. Legal basis: The processing of your account data and usage data for recommendations from Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR, and the processing of health data for recommendation from Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to my account data, usage data and health data I track in the Clue app being processed so Clue can send me personal recommendations for relevant products based on my tracked experiences. Certain third-party providers, including some located outside of the European Union, are used to help with this. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for providing personal recommendations is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.7 To help Clue optimize their advertising efforts To help us analyze how Clue’s advertising performs, we process certain types of usage data (for example when you install the Clue app or subscribe to Clue Plus) and technical data including your device ID and IP address. This helps us identify whether you’ve already downloaded Clue or have a Clue Plus subscription, and find out which Clue ads you interacted with (if any). By doing this, we can optimize our advertising efforts. For example, if you’ve already downloaded the Clue app, we won’t show you an ad to download Clue. It also helps us understand on which platforms people find out about us, and learn what kind of Clue advertising performs best. With better advertising, we can help raise awareness about the Clue app and empower more people to take charge of their health. Third party providers: We use certain third party services to help us with our advertising efforts. These include Apple Search Ads and Google Ads, both based in the United States, and Adjust and Taboola (described in more detail below). Adjust: Clue uses services operated by Adjust, a company based in Germany, to measure and improve campaign performance through attribution and analytics. They help us understand where our users are coming from, which age group they are from, and how they are interacting with our app, so that we can optimize our ad campaigns. Adjust uses your advertising identifier (Apple IDFA on iOS, Google Play Services ID on Android), and your IP addresses to provide us these insights. Through Adjust, we share standard app events like installation of the Clue app or subscription to Clue Plus services with certain advertisement networks like Meta and Tiktok. We do this to avoid showing you Clue ads if you’ve already downloaded or are subscribed to Clue Plus. Adjust does not have access to any of the personal health data you track in the app, and therefore cannot share this sensitive information with any advertisement networks the platform corresponds with. Adjust does not have access to any of the personal health data you track in the app. You can read more about how Adjust handles data in their Privacy PolicyTaboola: Clue uses an advertising service by Taboola, a company based in Germany. They allow us to find new users through their ad platform and optimize our advertising efforts by better understanding where our users come from. With their service, we can identify if users visited specific Clue website landing pages via Clue advertisements hosted by Taboola. This is done by adding a Taboola pixel to our Clue landing pages, and Taboola placing cookies on our website (see Section 7.2). The pixel is a small file that saves information about the visiting user’s device, operating system, and IP address. This is done only if the person agreed to our website’s analytical cookies. The data is pseudonymized in this process. You can read more about how Taboola handles data in their Privacy Policy.Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Be assured that the sensitive health data you track in the Clue app is never shared with or sold to advertisers. We do share a minimal amount of technical data with advertising networks, as described above, so that you won’t see a Clue ad if you’ve already downloaded the app or subscribed to Clue Plus.Legal basis: The processing of your usage data to promote Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to my usage and device data being processed so Clue can optimize their advertising efforts to more effectively tell more people about Clue. Certain third party providers, including some located outside of the European Union, are used to help with this. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected to help to promote Clue is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.8 To optimize advertising with activity tracking (iOS users only) To help us optimize our advertising and to spread the word about Clue, we enable activity tracking on iOS devices when permissions are turned on. Activity tracking means that limited technical data (like your device ID) and usage data (for example installing Clue or subscribing to Clue Plus) is shared with advertisers so you don’t see Clue ads that aren’t relevant to you. You can turn off activity tracking any time in your iOS Settings.Activity tracking is strictly limited to technical and usage data. Your health data is never shared with advertisers and always protected. Legal basis: The processing of your usage data for activity tracking is based on the following consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR, if you selected “Allow” when presented the following prompt from Apple: Allow “Clue” to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites? All personal data collected for activity tracking is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.9 To optimize our advertising efforts and to improve helloclue.com with website analytics To optimize our advertising efforts and to improve our website, we process usage data such as your IP address and device data. This helps us track the performance of our website, understand how you use our website, and offer you an improved experience. For this purpose we use cookies and third party tracking services.

If you consent to the non-essential cookies, you may withdraw your consent again at any time in your browser’s cookie settings. All personal data collected for website analytics is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.10 To deliver Clue newsletters To provide newsletter and email services, we process certain contact data of those people who have opted in so we can send such communications. If you’ve registered for a newsletter service of Clue, without being a Clue app user with an account, we will process your information provided in the registration on helloclue.com. This may include your name and email address, which is needed to send you the newsletters you’ve subscribed to. If you’re a Clue app user with an account, Clue will process the email address you provided with your account registration to send you the newsletters you’ve subscribed to, as well as occasional emails with promotional content. The content of these communications will be for similar Clue services to what you use, or may include promotion for third party products which may be relevant to you from partnerships we support. If you’ve requested Cycle Review emails as part of your Clue Plus subscription, then that email will also contain a summary of personal health data that you have tracked in the app. Third parties: Clue may share information such as your email address to third-party providers for the sole purpose of carrying out our newsletter services. Our current provider for this service is Braze. For more information about Braze, see Section 3.1.1. Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Legal basis: The legal basis for sending you our newsletter is based on your consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR. The legal basis for promotional emails is based on Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) and lit f) GDPR. The legal basis for Cycle Review emails is based on your consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR. You can unsubscribe from our newsletters, promotional emails, and Cycle Review emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails. All personal data collected for providing our newsletter services is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 3.11 To gain insights from surveys and interviews To receive feedback from the Clue community, Clue may use surveys and run interviews to gain insights on certain health topics, the performance of the app, or the value of features. Any information given by you via such surveys is processed by Clue for the purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Third party providers: Clue uses easyfeedback GmbH “Easyfeedback"", a survey tool provider based in Germany, to run surveys and process results. They may process data from surveys you choose to participate in for science research, user experience research, or customer satisfaction research. In case personal data is processed for a survey, you will be asked for an explicit consent. Your Clue app data is never shared with Easyfeedback. Clue also uses UserTesting, a provider located in the United States, for conducting user experience studies. If you’re invited to sign up to a study pool via a Clue survey, you’ll be taken to the UserTesting website and be asked to provide your name and email to enter the pool. The selection of participants is carried out by UserTesting, therefore, we cannot guarantee that you will be invited to participate in a further study or interview. Legal basis: The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in a survey is your consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR. In case health data is involved, the legal basis is Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR. All personal data collected for the provisioning of our surveys and interviews is deleted by us immediately as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. 4. Data transfer outside the European Union Any personal data collected from you may only be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if we observe applicable privacy regulations and ensure that your privacy rights remain protected. To ensure an adequate level of data protection in accordance with Art 46 GDPR, we have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with all non-EEA third parties whose data processing tools we use (data processors) if there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for their particular country. For U.S. based data processing, we also use third-party providers that are certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework as a guarantee under Art 46 GDPR. You can read more about the Standard Contractual Clauses here. The Standard Contractual Clauses help us to implement an adequate level of data protection between Clue and our processors, who must agree to follow strict data protection rules. However, they do not bind the governmental bodies of the non-EEA country in which our processor operates. In some cases, governments may have powers of surveillance that run contrary to EU law data protection principles. We choose our processors very carefully. We do not work with processors based in countries where we are concerned about the rule of law with respect to privacy. We follow the guidance of the European Data Protection Board on additional contractual and technical measures to ensure a sufficient level of privacy in different situations. 5. Your data protection rights We believe that privacy—including data privacy—is a basic human right. At Clue we strive to ensure that your rights are respected. Here are some key facts about your privacy that we would like you to know: i. Our products and services have been designed to collect only the data necessary to provide our services. We only collect and process your data for the purposes outlined above and detailed in this Privacy Policy. ii. The security of our servers is routinely verified by experts to protect your data from unauthorized access. You can contact us at <trust@helloclue.com> if you have any questions about the security of our services. iii. We do not retain your data in an identifiable format for longer than necessary to deliver our services. iv. Clue does not engage in any automated decision-making or profiling activities. As a user of the Clue app and website, you may exercise your rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to: i. Request information on your personal data processed by Clue. Upon your request, this information will be provided to you electronically. You can contact us to request your information at <trust@helloclue.com>. ii. Gain access to your information by requesting a copy of your data in a format that is readable by other companies or organizations (data portability). iii. Correct your personal information and health data in the app settings and in the tracking categories available in the Clue app. iv. Withdraw your consent from ongoing data processing at any time by deleting your account (for details see the Support section of the Clue app, under “Account Questions”), changing your privacy preferences in Settings, and/or unsubscribing from our newsletter or other email communications by clicking the link at bottom of the email. v. Request the complete deletion of your data, including all past data sent to third-party services used for tracking and analysis, by reaching out to <trust@helloclue.com>. Your data will be deleted within 1 month.vi. Lodge a complaint with the relevant supervising authority if you believe Clue is processing your personal data in violation of applicable data protection regulations. 6. Data security procedures Protecting your data privacy is at the core of what we do. We apply security measures to protect against misuse, loss, and/or alteration of personal information under our control. We follow industry standards when transferring and storing your data. Though we cannot ensure or guarantee that misuse, loss or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. 6.1 How Clue secures your personal data When you create an account with Clue, your personal profile data is stored separately from your health data and your service settings. Doing this means your health data has an even higher level of protection. Clue uses servers located in the European Union to process and store your personal data. When you create your Clue password, it’s stored using one-way encryption with both “hashing” and “salting” techniques. This means your password is combined with a random string of characters and then scrambled up so it's unreadable. Not even Clue staff have access to your password. Doing this ensures extra protection for your password. Note that if you use social login to create your account (see Section 3.1.3), Clue does not receive your original password. When your data is sent between your device and our Clue servers, we use hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). This is a type of encrypted data transmission, which scrambles the information being sent so it’s unreadable. Doing this increases the security of your data transfer. HTTPS is the same technology used to create secure connections for your web browser and is indicated by a padlock icon in the URL bar of your browser. When you subscribe to Clue Plus, all your payment information is securely processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Clue does not store your payment information at any time. 6.2 Clue’s recommendations for protecting your data Usually, the biggest threat to the security and privacy of your data is that someone—probably someone you know—gains access to any of your devices without your consent. The data you enter into Clue is private and it should stay that way. If you actively choose to share your data, for example if you are using Clue Connect, make sure to regularly review whether it still makes sense for you to share that information with your connections. Here are some tips on how to keep your devices secure: Protect your Clue account: Make sure to create a unique long password for your Clue account. We recommend using a password manager for this purpose. Protect your device:i. Activate either passcode, TouchID, or FaceID authentication for your device. This automatically secures your Clue data and prevents any person from using your device without your permission. ii. Set up a feature that will allow you to erase all the data from your device if it’s been lost or stolen. For iOS, activating this feature is a two-step process. First, activate “Find My iPhone” (instructions here) and then enable “Erase your device” (instructions here). For Android, set up Find My Device and, if needed, use the connected web interface to lock or wipe your phone remotely. 7.

We use professional translators and proofreaders to translate all of our communications, including this Privacy Policy, as accurately as possible into those languages. However, please understand that we cannot assure 100% accuracy for all of our translations, in particular with respect to any legal content. Please note that the English version of this Privacy Policy is therefore the original version, which prevails over all other versions in case of deviation from the English original. The most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy is always available in English on our website. Last updated July 23, 2025 At Clue, we believe that technology and data present a groundbreaking opportunity to empower people to take control of their health. The Clue app gives people the ability to understand what is going on inside of their bodies and minds based on individual tracked health data, providing self-insight and self-advocacy that’s powered by data processing. We also fully acknowledge the responsibility that comes with being the safekeepers of so much intimate data which is tracked by people using Clue. Which is why we are always striving to achieve the highest standards of privacy and security. Keeping your data safe is at the core of everything we do. We see it as our job to be clear and transparent so that you can truly understand what we do with your data, even though the digital ecosystem of an app is complex. To provide our service as a health app, we rely on a number of other providers as summarized below to help us. Please read the whole of this Privacy Policy to understand how we handle your data. We have done our best to make it as clear and comprehensible as possible. If you have any questions, reach out to us at <trust@helloclue.com>. If you are a US resident, you can read our Supplemental US Privacy Notice here. We process three types of data in order to provide our services on the Clue app and the helloclue.com website. All of our data is securely stored on servers located in the European Union (EU). Account data: In order to create your Clue account, we process some of your personal data such as a username, date of birth and email address. Usage data: In order to provide our services and technically improve performance, we process how you interact with our products using different data points. Such data includes device data, which informs us about the device you use to access our app services (such as device model, name and identifiers, device settings, application identifier, crash information). On our website, we also collect information about your browser (such as browser settings, operating system, system settings). Other usage data includes the IP address provided by your browser or mobile device, which we collect in order to deliver the service to your device. We also use the IP address to determine your approximate location for statistical and analytics purposes, and for regulatory compliance in different countries. We do not collect your precise location. Health data: In order to provide our service as a health app, we process health data and other sensitive data that you choose to track in the Clue app. Such health data may include your cycle information (e.g. period length, pain, or spotting), and depending on the data you provide, it may also contain other sensitive data about your experiences (e.g. weight, body temperature, hair quality, sexual intercourse). We only process the health data you choose to share with the Clue app via tracking. You may use different methods provided by the app to track your health data in the app. This can include manually entering your data into the app, or importing your data from other integrations or devices supported by Clue (such as Apple Health or fitness trackers). Data processing is essential to providing the service of Clue. Whenever you use our services, some personal and non-personal data is collected, stored, and analyzed using internal and third-party tools. Below are the purposes for which we process your data, and the type of data that’s processed to fulfill each purpose: To provide our service, we process the following: Health data: This is processed whenever you track your health data in the Clue app, either manually or through import integrations, in order to provide our core service as a health tracking app. This includes both your cycle information data and other sensitive data that you choose to track in the Clue app. Device data, event data, usage data, IP address: This is processed when you use the Clue app or helloclue.com, to understand how you interact with our services and to technically improve performance.

Wellhub: This section is only applicable to users who sign up for Clue Plus via Wellhub. Clue has partnered with Wellhub (formerly Gympass), a health and wellbeing platform located in the United States, that enables its members to access many health and wellbeing services. Clue Plus is part of their service offering. If you choose to sign up for Clue Plus using your Wellhub subscription, Wellhub sends Clue your Wellhub ID as confirmation that you are a Wellhub subscriber. Upon receiving this information, Clue will then activate your Clue Plus subscription. Clue shares with Wellhub whether you have been active in the Clue app. This is done by sending an event called ‘Create Record’ to Wellhub. At no point does Wellhub ever receive any of your tracked health data. Legal basis: Our legal basis for processing the above mentioned data is Art. 6 b) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which means that we use it to perform the contract that you have entered into with Clue, via Wellhub. We also process your Clue account data and usage data on the legal basis of Art 6 Sec.1 lit b) GDPR to provide our services to you. The processing of health data to provide our service to you is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR: I agree to Clue processing the health data I choose to share with the app, so they can provide their service.

To help a Clue user who has contacted our Support Team with questions regarding our services, we may communicate with this person via email to provide customer service. Providing this service is part of our paid Clue Plus subscription. If you use this service, Clue will have to access and process your personal data, including your health data depending on the nature of your query. We do this so we can adequately provide you support with your request.Third party providers: To provide customer support and communicate with you, Clue uses services from Slack Technologies Ltd (“Slack”), based in Ireland, and Zendesk, Inc. (“Zendesk”), based in the United States. We also use Growthdot, a company based in Ukraine, to anonymise customer support communications at the end of the retention period. Whenever data is transferred to providers outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Legal basis:The legal basis for processing your account data and usage data for customer service is Art 6 Sec. 1 lit b) GDPR, and Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR for your health data.

To help advance menstrual and reproductive health studies, we share relevant de-identified health data you’ve tracked in the Clue app with carefully selected research partners to be used in their scientific studies. When you track in Clue, your data becomes something powerful. It can help answer questions to better understand menstrual and reproductive health. Women and people with cycles are still widely underrepresented in health research. We believe that the data tracked in Clue can change this. By teaming up with our trusted research partners we can advance research, break harmful taboos and lay the groundwork for better healthcare. We only share data that is directly relevant to the research question and follow strict protocols to ensure your data always remains anonymous to the researchers. We use a de-identification technique which means all personal identifiers like your name and email address are erased. Your dataset is then assigned a random ID, making sure you can’t be identified by the researchers. If you are a participant in a scientific study that is run by a research facility using Clue as a tool to collect information for that study, then Clue will share your personal information with the research facility only under the terms of your consent as given to that research facility. When you use Clue as part of a scientific study, we will otherwise treat your personal data with the same care as we do all user data. The research facility will be solely responsible for the usage of your personal data, including health data, in the context of their scientific study. We consider that Clue and our partnered research facilities have joint responsibility (""joint controllership"" under GDPR) in this case. Research partners: We team up with carefully selected research partners both in and outside of the European Union. You can read more about the type of research partnerships we have here. Whenever data is transferred to partners outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Legal basis: The processing of your health data for scientific research is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to the health data I track in the app being de-identified and shared with carefully selected research partners in and outside of the European Union to advance menstrual and reproductive health studies. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for scientific research is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. To help us build more valuable features in Clue, we process health data you’ve tracked in the app to better understand which features are most useful to you. By processing data such as period dates and cycle experiences, we can better understand how our community uses the app and further tailor the experience to fit their needs. By analyzing how our community uses the app, we can understand which features are most valuable. We use these insights to drive feature development, so we can make sure to deliver what’s most important. This could include things like improving the accuracy of predictions, building new algorithms to offer you more health insights, or creating content about topics we see our community wants to read about more. The processing of health data for analytics purposes is managed internally by Clue. We store your data on servers in the EU and it’s always de-identified, removing personal identifiers like your name and email address. These procedures ensure your privacy. Third party providers: We do not use any third party providers for this purpose. Legal basis: The processing of your health data for health analytics is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to the health data I track in the app being processed for analytics purposes so Clue can improve my predictions, develop new algorithms and create more valuable features with personalized insights. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for the health data analytics is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. To help us improve the Clue app experience, we process and analyze certain data so we can improve the app and make features easier to use. This includes usage data like your device ID and IP address. By improving the app and its technical platform, we can deliver a better experience for you and the wider Clue community. It allows us to tailor the app to different types of devices, and most importantly, strive to make the app experience the best it can be. Third party providers: We do not use any third party providers for this purpose. Legal basis: We process your usage data on the legal basis of Art 6 Sec.1 lit f) GDPR to technically improve the Clue app based on Clue’s legitimate interest as a company to continuously improve the app and deliver an improved service to you. We do not believe there is anything you could have against this. However you can always opt out of this data processing at any time in your Clue app’s privacy settings by toggling off: As outlined in Clue’s Privacy Policy and based on Clue’s legitimate interest as a company to continuously improve the app, certain usage and technical data is processed. I have the right to opt out of this at any time. All personal data collected to technically improve the Clue app is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. To make personalized recommendations, we process certain usage data to understand how you interact with the Clue app, as well as the health data you’ve tracked to deliver you more personalized insights. This includes data such as your period dates and cycle experiences. We also collect your account data so we can then send you these recommendations via in-app messages, emails, and push notifications (if you’ve enabled permissions on your device). By personalizing your experience, we can provide information that’s more tailored to you and your needs. This might look like sending you updates about new Clue features based on what you’ve tracked, or suggesting interesting products from partnerships we support that may be relevant to you. For example, if you’re trying to conceive, we might recommend services that can support you on your conception journey. We strive to be mindful about what we communicate and how often, as providing you with the most comfortable experience possible is our main priority. Third party providers: We use certain third party software providers to help us send these updates, such as Braze (see Section 3.1.1). These providers are not permitted to use the data for any other purpose other than to help Clue personalize your experience. Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Be assured that the sensitive health data you track in the Clue app is never shared with or sold to advertisers, or any partners whose services we may recommend in Clue. Legal basis: The processing of your account data and usage data for recommendations from Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR, and the processing of health data for recommendation from Clue is based on the following consent according to Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR, if you have toggled this on in your privacy settings: I agree to my account data, usage data and health data I track in the Clue app being processed so Clue can send me personal recommendations for relevant products based on my tracked experiences. Certain third-party providers, including some located outside of the European Union, are used to help with this. You can toggle this off at any time. All personal data collected for providing personal recommendations is deleted by us as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. To help us analyze how Clue’s advertising performs, we process certain types of usage data (for example when you install the Clue app or subscribe to Clue Plus) and technical data including your device ID and IP address. This helps us identify whether you’ve already downloaded Clue or have a Clue Plus subscription, and find out which Clue ads you interacted with (if any). By doing this, we can optimize our advertising efforts. For example, if you’ve already downloaded the Clue app, we won’t show you an ad to download Clue. It also helps us understand on which platforms people find out about us, and learn what kind of Clue advertising performs best. With better advertising, we can help raise awareness about the Clue app and empower more people to take charge of their health. Third party providers: We use certain third party services to help us with our advertising efforts. These include Apple Search Ads and Google Ads, both based in the United States, and Adjust and Taboola (described in more detail below). Adjust: Clue uses services operated by Adjust, a company based in Germany, to measure and improve campaign performance through attribution and analytics. They help us understand where our users are coming from, which age group they are from, and how they are interacting with our app, so that we can optimize our ad campaigns. Adjust uses your advertising identifier (Apple IDFA on iOS, Google Play Services ID on Android), and your IP addresses to provide us these insights. Through Adjust, we share standard app events like installation of the Clue app or subscription to Clue Plus services with certain advertisement networks like Meta and Tiktok. We do this to avoid showing you Clue ads if you’ve already downloaded or are subscribed to Clue Plus. Adjust does not have access to any of the personal health data you track in the app, and therefore cannot share this sensitive information with any advertisement networks the platform corresponds with. Adjust does not have access to any of the personal health data you track in the app. You can read more about how Adjust handles data in their Privacy Policy Taboola: Clue uses an advertising service by Taboola, a company based in Germany. They allow us to find new users through their ad platform and optimize our advertising efforts by better understanding where our users come from. With their service, we can identify if users visited specific Clue website landing pages via Clue advertisements hosted by Taboola. This is done by adding a Taboola pixel to our Clue landing pages, and Taboola placing cookies on our website (see Section 7.2). The pixel is a small file that saves information about the visiting user’s device, operating system, and IP address. This is done only if the person agreed to our website’s analytical cookies. The data is pseudonymized in this process. You can read more about how Taboola handles data in their Privacy Policy.Whenever data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), we always apply the appropriate safeguards as outlined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see Section 4). Be assured that the sensitive health data you track in the Clue app is never shared with or sold to advertisers.

To provide newsletter and email services, we process certain contact data of those people who have opted in so we can send such communications. If you’ve registered for a newsletter service of Clue, without being a Clue app user with an account, we will process your information provided in the registration on helloclue.com. This may include your name and email address, which is needed to send you the newsletters you’ve subscribed to. If you’re a Clue app user with an account, Clue will process the email address you provided with your account registration to send you the newsletters you’ve subscribed to, as well as occasional emails with promotional content. The content of these communications will be for similar Clue services to what you use, or may include promotion for third party products which may be relevant to you from partnerships we support. If you’ve requested Cycle Review emails as part of your Clue Plus subscription, then that email will also contain a summary of personal health data that you have tracked in the app. Third parties: Clue may share information such as your email address to third-party providers for the sole purpose of carrying out our newsletter services.

To receive feedback from the Clue community, Clue may use surveys and run interviews to gain insights on certain health topics, the performance of the app, or the value of features. Any information given by you via such surveys is processed by Clue for the purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Third party providers: Clue uses easyfeedback GmbH “Easyfeedback"", a survey tool provider based in Germany, to run surveys and process results. They may process data from surveys you choose to participate in for science research, user experience research, or customer satisfaction research. In case personal data is processed for a survey, you will be asked for an explicit consent. Your Clue app data is never shared with Easyfeedback. Clue also uses UserTesting, a provider located in the United States, for conducting user experience studies. If you’re invited to sign up to a study pool via a Clue survey, you’ll be taken to the UserTesting website and be asked to provide your name and email to enter the pool. The selection of participants is carried out by UserTesting, therefore, we cannot guarantee that you will be invited to participate in a further study or interview. Legal basis: The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in a survey is your consent according to Art 6 Sec.1 lit a) GDPR. In case health data is involved, the legal basis is Art 9 Sec.2 lit a) GDPR. All personal data collected for the provisioning of our surveys and interviews is deleted by us immediately as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. Any personal data collected from you may only be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if we observe applicable privacy regulations and ensure that your privacy rights remain protected. To ensure an adequate level of data protection in accordance with Art 46 GDPR, we have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with all non-EEA third parties whose data processing tools we use (data processors) if there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission for their particular country. For U.S. based data processing, we also use third-party providers that are certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework as a guarantee under Art 46 GDPR. You can read more about the Standard Contractual Clauses here. The Standard Contractual Clauses help us to implement an adequate level of data protection between Clue and our processors, who must agree to follow strict data protection rules. However, they do not bind the governmental bodies of the non-EEA country in which our processor operates. In some cases, governments may have powers of surveillance that run contrary to EU law data protection principles. We choose our processors very carefully. We do not work with processors based in countries where we are concerned about the rule of law with respect to privacy. We follow the guidance of the European Data Protection Board on additional contractual and technical measures to ensure a sufficient level of privacy in different situations. We believe that privacy—including data privacy—is a basic human right. At Clue we strive to ensure that your rights are respected. Here are some key facts about your privacy that we would like you to know: i. Our products and services have been designed to collect only the data necessary to provide our services. We only collect and process your data for the purposes outlined above and detailed in this Privacy Policy. ii. The security of our servers is routinely verified by experts to protect your data from unauthorized access. You can contact us at <trust@helloclue.com> if you have any questions about the security of our services. iii. We do not retain your data in an identifiable format for longer than necessary to deliver our services. iv. Clue does not engage in any automated decision-making or profiling activities. As a user of the Clue app and website, you may exercise your rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to: i. Request information on your personal data processed by Clue. Upon your request, this information will be provided to you electronically. You can contact us to request your information at <trust@helloclue.com>. ii. Gain access to your information by requesting a copy of your data in a format that is readable by other companies or organizations (data portability). iii. Correct your personal information and health data in the app settings and in the tracking categories available in the Clue app. iv. Withdraw your consent from ongoing data processing at any time by deleting your account (for details see the Support section of the Clue app, under “Account Questions”), changing your privacy preferences in Settings, and/or unsubscribing from our newsletter or other email communications by clicking the link at bottom of the email. v. Request the complete deletion of your data, including all past data sent to third-party services used for tracking and analysis, by reaching out to <trust@helloclue.com>. Your data will be deleted within 1 month.vi. Lodge a complaint with the relevant supervising authority if you believe Clue is processing your personal data in violation of applicable data protection regulations. Protecting your data privacy is at the core of what we do. We apply security measures to protect against misuse, loss, and/or alteration of personal information under our control. We follow industry standards when transferring and storing your data. Though we cannot ensure or guarantee that misuse, loss or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. When you create an account with Clue, your personal profile data is stored separately from your health data and your service settings. Doing this means your health data has an even higher level of protection. Clue uses servers located in the European Union to process and store your personal data. When you create your Clue password, it’s stored using one-way encryption with both “hashing” and “salting” techniques. This means your password is combined with a random string of characters and then scrambled up so it's unreadable. Not even Clue staff have access to your password. Doing this ensures extra protection for your password. Note that if you use social login to create your account (see Section 3.1.3), Clue does not receive your original password. When your data is sent between your device and our Clue servers, we use hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). This is a type of encrypted data transmission, which scrambles the information being sent so it’s unreadable. Doing this increases the security of your data transfer. HTTPS is the same technology used to create secure connections for your web browser and is indicated by a padlock icon in the URL bar of your browser. When you subscribe to Clue Plus, all your payment information is securely processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Clue does not store your payment information at any time. Usually, the biggest threat to the security and privacy of your data is that someone—probably someone you know—gains access to any of your devices without your consent. The data you enter into Clue is private and it should stay that way. If you actively choose to share your data, for example if you are using Clue Connect, make sure to regularly review whether it still makes sense for you to share that information with your connections. Here are some tips on how to keep your devices secure: Protect your Clue account: Make sure to create a unique long password for your Clue account. We recommend using a password manager for this purpose. Protect your device: i. Activate either passcode, TouchID, or FaceID authentication for your device. This automatically secures your Clue data and prevents any person from using your device without your permission. ii. Set up a feature that will allow you to erase all the data from your device if it’s been lost or stolen. For iOS, activating this feature is a two-step process.

This Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use. Unless otherwise noted, your use of the Site and Services constitutes your agreement to Crunch using information about you in accordance with this Policy.

In the event we make material changes to the Policy, we will provide notice through the Site, and we suggest that you check from time to time to review how we treat your personal information (“PI”). You understand and agree that your continued use of the Site or Services after the effective date means that the collection, use, and sharing of your PI is subject to the updated Policy.

Under certain circumstances, we may not be able to fulfill your request such as when it interferes with our regulatory obligations, affects legal matters, we cannot verify your identity, or it involves disproportionate cost or effort. Still, in any event, we will endeavor to respond to your request within forty five (45) days and provide you with an explanation if we are not able to comply with your request.

The other provisions of this Policy continue to apply except as modified by the state section applicable to you. Please read the relevant state section carefully before using the Site and Services or otherwise submitting your personal information to us. Except as otherwise noted, any capitalized terms not defined in a state-specific section have the meaning set forth in the Policy and Terms of Use. With the exception of the California section, these state sections do not apply to personal information we obtain about you in a commercial or employment context. By accessing or using the Site or Services, or otherwise submitting personal information to us, you indicate your understanding that the collection, use, and sharing of your information is subject to the terms of the relevant state section, the Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use. If you do not consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information as described, please do not use the Site or Services or otherwise provide us with such information. Consumer Rights. These state-specific sections include rights you may have under the applicable state law and information on how to exercise them. Where permitted by law, we reserve the right to respond only to a verifiable request to exercise a right. A verifiable request may be made by any of the following: • the Consumer who is the subject of the request, • a Consumer on behalf of the Consumer’s minor child, or • a natural person or person registered with the Secretary of State authorized to act on behalf of a Consumer, where permitted by applicable law. If we request, you must provide sufficient information to verify your identity and/or authority to act on behalf of a Consumer. In general, we may ask you to provide identifying information that we already maintain about you or we may use a third-party verification service. In either event, we will try to avoid asking you for sensitive Personal Information to verify your identity. We may not be able to respond to your request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and/or confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Please note that making a Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. Additionally, you will need to describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to review, understand, assess, and respond. We will not use the Personal Information we collect from an individual to determine a verifiable request for any other purpose, except as required by law. Fees. We reserve the right to charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will attempt to notify you as to why we made that decision and provide a cost estimate before completing your request. We will attempt to respond to a verifiable Consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, but we may require up to ninety (90) days to respond, under which circumstances we will notify you of the need for an extension. Response. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable Consumer request. • California residents: With respect to Personal Information collected on and after January 1, 2022, and to the extent expressly permitted by applicable regulation, you may request that such disclosures cover a period beyond the 12 months referenced above, provided doing so would not be impossible or require a disproportionate effort by us. Agents. Subject to certain limitations, you may authorize a natural person or a business registered with the applicable Secretary of State to act on your behalf with respect to exercising your rights under a state section. Unless you have provided the authorized agent with a qualifying power of attorney, you must provide your authorized agent with written permission (signed by you) to act on your behalf and verify their identity with us. We reserve the right to deny requests from persons or businesses claiming to be authorized agents that do not submit sufficient proof of their authorization. The following state- specific limitations apply to agents: • Colorado: An agent may submit only a request to Opt Out of the processing of Personal Data concerning the Consumer for purposes of Targeted Advertising or the Sale of Personal Data. • Connecticut: An agent may exercise only the right to Opt Out of processing of Personal Data concerning the Consumer for purposes of Targeted Advertising, the Sale of Personal Data, or Profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer. • Oregon: An agent may exercise only the right to Opt Out of processing of Personal Data concerning the Consumer for purposes of Targeted Advertising, the Sale of Personal Data, or Profiling. • Texas: An agent may submit only a request to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising or the selling of Personal Data.

IMPORTANT: BY USING THE SITE AND SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE ANALYTICS PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. We may provide links to websites or resources outside of our Site for your informational purposes only. We may also provide links to third-party integrations. Third-party integrations are websites or platforms that synchronize with our Site to provide you with additional functionality, tools, or services such as maps, sending requested information, etc. You acknowledge and agree we are not responsible for the availability of third-party sites, resources, or integrations and do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, goods, services, or other materials on, available through, or provided by such sites, resources, or integrations. We are not responsible for the privacy or other practices of such sites and cannot guarantee the security of personal information that you provide, or is collected by, such sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms and conditions on those linked sites. We retain your PI for as long as necessary, such as to provide you products and Services or while you have an open membership with us. We may retain your PI for longer if it is necessary to comply with our legal or reporting obligations, resolve disputes, collect fees, etc. or as permitted or required by applicable law. We may also retain your PI in a deidentified or aggregated form so that it can no longer be associated with you. To determine the appropriate retention period for your PI, we consider various factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your information; the potential risk of unauthorized access, use or disclosure; the purposes for which we process your PI; and applicable legal requirements. Crunch has implemented a comprehensive data privacy and security program, which includes reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to safeguard and protect the personal information we collect or you share with us. Independent third-party auditors have assessed Crunch‘s operations against recognized security standards and controls on a product-specific basis. Any payment transactions are encrypted and handled through our third-party payment processors. We do not have access to, store or retain your full credit card number or related financial information. You are responsible for keeping the password to your membership account confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. No system for safeguarding personal or other information is 100% secure. Even though we have taken steps to protect your PI from being intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with PI. We offer a downloadable native member (iOS and Android) app (“App”). You can use this App to book classes, log workouts, and check in to a Crunch club with the digital barcode. The App does not have e-commerce functionality. Our App may collect personal and other information as described in Section 1 that will be used or disclosed in accordance with this Policy. We provide a link to this Policy to persons prior to their downloading of any of our App. If you allow our mobile App to access your location information on your device, our mobile App may use your mobile device’s Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and other technology (such as wireless transmitters known as beacons) to provide you with information and offers based on the location of your device. Beacons allow us to collect information about your location within participating properties by communicating with mobile devices in range. We may use this location information to enhance your experience by delivering push notifications and other content to your mobile device, providing navigation assistance as you move around our locations, and sending you information and offers about products, services, or activities we believe may be of interest to you. We may share this information with third parties, including business partners and service providers, to provide information, offers, and services that may be of interest to you. You may prevent or limit the collection of location information by changing the settings in the App or by changing your device settings. The Site is not directed to children under the age of eighteen (18) and the products and services on this Site are not intended for persons under the age of sixteen. We intend Crunch’s web pages for general audiences – we do not seek through our Site to gather PI from or about persons under sixteen years of age. If you inform us or we otherwise become aware that we have unintentionally received PI from an individual under the age of sixteen, we will delete this information from our records. When we collect information for membership inquiry purposes, users are informed they must be at least 18 years of age or have parental consent to provide personally identifying information to us. We encourage parents to monitor children's Internet use to keep them safe while navigating Crunch.com and all other areas of the Internet. If your child attends Kids Crunch, we collect certain personal information that you provide, as noted in Section 1, above. Access.Crunch respects your control over your information, and, upon request, we will confirm whether we hold or are processing PI that we have collected from you. You also have the right to amend or update inaccurate or incomplete PI, request deletion of your PI, or request that we no longer use it. Under certain circumstances, we may not be able to fulfill your request such as when it interferes with our regulatory obligations, affects legal matters, we cannot verify your identity, or it involves disproportionate cost or effort. Still, in any event, we will endeavor to respond to your request within forty five (45) days and provide you with an explanation if we are not able to comply with your request. Please note that for PI we have obtained about you or received for processing on behalf of a separate, unaffiliated entity – which determined the means and purposes of processing - all such requests should be made directly to that entity. We will honor and support any instructions they provide us concerning your PI. Cookies. For information on how to control cookies, please see section 6, above. Mobile Phone Numbers.

For example, even if you opt-out of promotional communications, we may still send you a notification of changes to, expiration of, or discontinuation of a program or class you are enrolled in. You can always limit the information you provide to us, but if you choose not to provide certain requested information, you may be unable to access some of the services, offers, or content on the Site. This Policy is governed by the internal substantive laws of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Jurisdiction for any claims arising under or out of this Policy shall lie exclusively with the state and federal courts within New York. If any provision of this Policy is found to be invalid by a court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect. If you have questions or requests relating to this Policy or your PI, please contact us at www.crunchprivacy.com, which allows you to contact us online, or email us at privacy@crunch.com.

If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Virginia, Utah, or Texas the following state specific provisions describe our policies and practices in accordance with the applicable state consumer data protection law regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that we obtain about you when you access or use the Site, our mobile application, and Services or through other channels (e.g., phone and e-mail conversations, viewing our emails, when you visit our locations or attend our events, or through authorized services providers or third parties). Capitalized terms used in the following state sections shall have the meanings set forth in the applicable state consumer data protection law. The other provisions of this Policy continue to apply except as modified by the state section applicable to you. Please read the relevant state section carefully before using the Site and Services or otherwise submitting your personal information to us. Except as otherwise noted, any capitalized terms not defined in a state-specific section have the meaning set forth in the Policy and Terms of Use. With the exception of the California section, these state sections do not apply to personal information we obtain about you in a commercial or employment context. By accessing or using the Site or Services, or otherwise submitting personal information to us, you indicate your understanding that the collection, use, and sharing of your information is subject to the terms of the relevant state section, the Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use. If you do not consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information as described, please do not use the Site or Services or otherwise provide us with such information. Consumer Rights. These state-specific sections include rights you may have under the applicable state law and information on how to exercise them. Where permitted by law, we reserve the right to respond only to a verifiable request to exercise a right. A verifiable request may be made by any of the following: • the Consumer who is the subject of the request, • a Consumer on behalf of the Consumer’s minor child, or • a natural person or person registered with the Secretary of State authorized to act on behalf of a Consumer, where permitted by applicable law. If we request, you must provide sufficient information to verify your identity and/or authority to act on behalf of a Consumer. In general, we may ask you to provide identifying information that we already maintain about you or we may use a third-party verification service. In either event, we will try to avoid asking you for sensitive Personal Information to verify your identity. We may not be able to respond to your request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and/or confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Please note that making a Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. Additionally, you will need to describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to review, understand, assess, and respond. We will not use the Personal Information we collect from an individual to determine a verifiable request for any other purpose, except as required by law. Fees. We reserve the right to charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will attempt to notify you as to why we made that decision and provide a cost estimate before completing your request. We will attempt to respond to a verifiable Consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, but we may require up to ninety (90) days to respond, under which circumstances we will notify you of the need for an extension. Response. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of your verifiable Consumer request. • California residents: With respect to Personal Information collected on and after January 1, 2022, and to the extent expressly permitted by applicable regulation, you may request that such disclosures cover a period beyond the 12 months referenced above, provided doing so would not be impossible or require a disproportionate effort by us. Agents. Subject to certain limitations, you may authorize a natural person or a business registered with the applicable Secretary of State to act on your behalf with respect to exercising your rights under a state section. Unless you have provided the authorized agent with a qualifying power of attorney, you must provide your authorized agent with written permission (signed by you) to act on your behalf and verify their identity with us. We reserve the right to deny requests from persons or businesses claiming to be authorized agents that do not submit sufficient proof of their authorization. The following state- specific limitations apply to agents: • Colorado: An agent may submit only a request to Opt Out of the processing of Personal Data concerning the Consumer for purposes of Targeted Advertising or the Sale of Personal Data. • Connecticut: An agent may exercise only the right to Opt Out of processing of Personal Data concerning the Consumer for purposes of Targeted Advertising, the Sale of Personal Data, or Profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer. • Oregon: An agent may exercise only the right to Opt Out of processing of Personal Data concerning the Consumer for purposes of Targeted Advertising, the Sale of Personal Data, or Profiling. • Texas: An agent may submit only a request to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising or the selling of Personal Data.

"privacy_policies/Curable.txt","Curable","Privacy Policy Effective and last updated on June 16, 2025. Curable Inc. knows that you care about how your personal information is collected, used, processed, and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the information we collect and that you may provide when you interact with us through our websites, software applications, social media pages, and other online services or advertisements (collectively, the “Services”), how we use and protect that information, and how we disclose that information. This policy describes our practices today, as well as our practices over the last 12 months. This policy provides important information about how to exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK-GDPR) and other laws. Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not accept our policies and practices, do not use the Services. This policy is incorporated into and made a part of our terms of use (https://www.curablehealth.com/terms) (“Terms of Use”). If you have not done so already, please also review our Terms of Use (https://www.curablehealth.com/terms). The Terms of Use contain provisions that limit our liability to you and require you to resolve any dispute with us on an individual basis and not as part of any class or representative action. By using the Services, you consent to our use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in this policy. You may withdraw your consent to our use of your information at any time by contacting us at support@curablehealth.com. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR TERMS OF SERVICE, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE SERVICES. We may update this privacy policy from time to time and post the new privacy policy on this page. However, if we make any material changes to this privacy policy, we will notify registered users by e-mail, post a notice on our home page, and/or alert you to such changes by other similar means. You may opt out of any remaining subscription if you decline to accept the revised privacy policy. Your continued use of our Services after we revise this policy means you accept those changes, so please check this policy periodically for updates. 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT We collect the following information from and about users of our Services: A. Information You Provide to Us When you interact with the Services, we may ask you to provide (or if not required, you may choose to provide) the following personal information: • First name; • Email address; • Phone number; and • Any other information you choose to provide us, which may include your medical conditions and your feelings regarding them. If you do not want information about your medical conditions or other information provided to us to be used or disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy, do not provide such information to us or do not use the Services. We collect this information when you register for the Services, subscribe to or purchase the Services, or when you use the Services, such as by filling in forms, answering questions, using live and automated chats, and by participating in online or virtual question and answer sessions. We also may collect this information when you communicate with us by email, fillable form, or chat. If you purchase anything from us, we do not collect your payment data. Instead, we use a third-party payment provider to whom you provide that information, and your interaction with that third-party payment provider is governed by its privacy policy, not ours. We also do not control the privacy practices of any third-party sites that you visit by clicking a link that is a part of our Services. You visit those sites at your own risk, and you understand and agree that you – and not Curable – are responsible for evaluating the privacy policies of those sites. B. Information Shared Through Curable Online Communities Our Services include online and virtual group discussions, lectures, question and answer sessions, and coaching sessions facilitated by both licensed professionals and professionals who are not licensed (collectively, “Virtual Programs”). Users participate in Virtual Programs through communication methods that may permit your voice or likeness to be shared with Curable facilitators and other Services users, including video and audio conference calls and virtual meetings. Virtual Programs are intended to provide users with an opportunity to discuss topics related to chronic pain management such as support and suggested resources for further exploration. In addition, Curable may also feature online message boards, social media groups and communities, chats, or other forums as part of the Services (collectively, “Public Forums”). You choose and control whether to participate in Virtual Programs and Public Forums and what, if any, information (including personal information) you share. While Curable will use any information you share in connection with Virtual Programs and Public Forums consistent with this Privacy Policy, we cannot control the actions of others with whom you choose to share your personal or other information during Virtual Programs and on Public Forums. Any information you share during Virtual Programs and on Public Forums, including personal information, is public and shared with others at your own risk. Certain Virtual Program sessions may be recorded by Curable and made available as part of the Services.

We do not collect information about your activities over time and across third-party websites, apps, or other online services. We do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals sent from web browsers that connect with the Services. D. Cookies “Cookies” are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the device you use to view a website. Each device that accesses our website is assigned a different cookie by Curable. We use session cookies, which are specific to a particular interaction with the Services and carry information as you view different pages. Session cookies expire and delete themselves automatically when you leave our Services or when you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies, which enable us to recognize you when you use our Services and remember your preferences, such as keeping you signed into your account with us.

Even if you do not register with FEMM, we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our Web site, special promotions, and newsletters. We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our website and your use of the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers through the use of Cookies. Every computer that accesses a FEMM Web site is assigned a different Cookie by FEMM. The information collected by Cookies (i) helps us dynamically generate advertising and content on Web pages or in newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website and selected sponsors’ and advertisers’ sites, (iii) how many people open our emails, and (iv) for what purposes these actions are being taken. We may use Cookie information to target certain advertisements to your browser or to determine the popularity of certain content or advertisements. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user’s log-in, as navigation aids and as session timers. Cookies used by FEMM may also be used to restrict underage use of the tools. Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, certain functions and conveniences of our Web site may not work properly. However, users who register with our site to use our tools and view our educational materials are required to accept our Cookies for proper operation. We do not link Non-Personal Information from Cookies to Personally Identifiable Information without your permission and do not use Cookies to collect or store Personal Health Information about you.

These third parties have agreed not to use Non-Personal Information they collect from our sites except to deliver advertisements on our behalf. If your browser is set to reject cookies, the Non-Personal Information will not be sent to these third parties. When you download and install our FEMM Mobile App onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App and please use your mobile device browser to access our websites or our mobile optimized sites.

If you choose to link to one of these Third Party Web sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on this other website to understand how that Third Party Web site collects and uses your Personally Identifiable Information. Here are some of the security procedures that FEMM uses to protect your privacy: FEMM Health System provides additional protection for your Personal Health Information as follows: Despite FEMM’s efforts to protect your Personally Identifiable Information and Personal Health Information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted. FEMM tools that collect and store self-reported data allow you to correct, update, or review information you have submitted by going back to the specific tool, logging in, and making the desired changes. FEMM may store user submitted data (Personally Identifiable Information and/or Personal Health Information) in an active database for a period of six (6) months. After six (6) months, user submitted data, including Personally Identifiable Information and/or Personal Health Information will be held in an active database or on an inactive back-up medium for a period of not less than six (6) years. If you have a complaint or problem, please contact us at support@femmhealth.org. Our customer service department will forward your complaint to the appropriate internal FEMM department for a response or resolution. We try to answer every email within 48 business hours, but may not always be able to do so. Upon your request, we will delete your Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information from our active databases and where feasible from our back-up media. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to FEMM from our servers. Personally Identifiable Information: We will inform you if a material change is made to the Privacy Policy, which means a change that expands the permissible uses or disclosures of Personally Identifiable Information allowed by the prior version of the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the FEMM Web site will indicate acceptance of the changes. You may of course choose to opt out of continuing to use the FEMM Web site. Please exit the site immediately if you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy. Personal Health Information: We will inform you if a material change in the Privacy Policy is made that involves the use of your Personal Health Information, and your express opt-in authorization will be requested. If you choose not to accept the new privacy policy, then the current privacy policy conditions will remain in effect, so long as FEMM continues to make the functionality available. FEMM reserves the right to discontinue or limit functionality in all its products including FEMM and FEMM Health System. Non-Significant Changes: FEMM may make non-significant changes to the Privacy Policy that do not affect Personally Identifiable Information or Personal Health Information. For these instances, FEMM may not notify you of such non-significant changes. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places appropriate throughout our site so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, and by means of a notice on our home page. Contacting Us If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us at the following: FEMM Foundation228 East 71st StreetNew York, NY 10021femm@femmhealth.org Non-Personal Information: Information that is not traceable back to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual. For example, information such as gender, age, city and state when not linked with other Personally Identifiable Information is Non-Personal Information. Personal Health Information (PHI): When your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is combined with known health characteristics. For example, if you indicated that you have a certain disease or condition, when that information is combined with your Personally Identifiable Information, it becomes Personal Health Information. Personally Identifiable Information (PII): (also called Personal Information): Information that can be traced back to an individual (contrast with Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Information). Examples of Personally Identifiable Information include your name, home address, telephone number, email address, and Social Security number. If other pieces of information are linked to Personally Identifiable Information, they also become Personally Identifiable Information. For example, if you use a nickname to chat online and give out your real name while chatting, your nickname becomes Personally Identifiable Information when linked with other Personally Identifiable Information. jQuery(document).ready(function(){ var title = jQuery('title').html(); if(title == 'Events Archive - FEMM Health'){ jQuery('title').html('Classes - FEMM Health'); } }); CONTACT US Facebook-f Twitter Youtube Our Organization About Us Annual Reports Careers Research Donate Terms of Use Privacy Policy Press Room About Us Annual Reports Careers Research Donate Terms of Use Privacy Policy Press Room SUPPORT 1 on 1 Support Take a class Telehealth Patient Portal Insurance Information 1 on 1 Support Take a class Telehealth Patient Portal Insurance Information HELP FAQs Guides & Tutorials FAQs Guides & Tutorials Connect Contact Us Find a Medical Provider Find a FEMM Teacher Blog Facebook Instagram Contact Us Find a Medical Provider Find a FEMM Teacher Blog Facebook Instagram Contact Us Find a Medical Provider Find a FEMM Teacher Blog Facebook Instagram Contact Us Find a Medical Provider Find a FEMM Teacher Blog Facebook Instagram Stay Connected Email ConsentBy supplying my contact information, I authorize FEMM Health to send me FEMM program and other information.CAPTCHA Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js_1"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); /* <![CDATA[ */ gform.initializeOnLoaded( function() {gformInitSpinner( 2, 'https://femmhealth.org/wp-content/plugins/gravityforms/images/spinner.svg', true );jQuery('#gform_ajax_frame_2').on('load',function(){var contents = jQuery(this).contents().find('*').html();var is_postback = contents.indexOf('GF_AJAX_POSTBACK') >= 0;if(!is_postback){return;}var form_content = jQuery(this).contents().find('#gform_wrapper_2');var is_confirmation = jQuery(this).contents().find('#gform_confirmation_wrapper_2').length > 0;var is_redirect = contents.indexOf('gformRedirect(){') >= 0;var is_form = form_content.length > 0 && !

"privacy_policies/FitBit.txt","FitBit","Fitbit Privacy PolicyLast update: September 16, 2024Note: If you use your Fitbit devices and services with a Google Account, then your data will be handled as described in the Google Privacy Policy, and as explained in more detail in these FAQs on Privacy. We believe that transparency is the key to any healthy relationship. At Fitbit, we’re all about healthy. We appreciate that you are trusting us with information that is important to you, and we want to be transparent about how we use it. Here we describe the privacy practices for our devices, applications, software, websites, APIs, products, and services (the “Services”). You will learn about the data we collect, how we use it, the controls we give you over your information, and the measures we take to keep it safe. Specifically, we’ll cover: Information We Collect How We Use Information How Information Is Shared Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data Data Retention Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others Our Policies for Children Information Security Our International Operations and Data Transfers European Privacy Disclosures California Privacy Disclosures Changes to This Policy Who We Are and How To Contact Us INFORMATION WE COLLECT When you use our Services, we collect the following types of information, some of which may be considered Consumer Health Data as defined in certain U.S. state laws such as the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US ACCOUNT INFORMATION Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number. This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us. You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services. You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends. If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message. PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history. If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. LIVE COACHING SERVICES Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES DEVICE INFORMATION Your device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of our various devices and how you can use MobileTrack. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers. GEOLOCATION INFORMATION The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. USAGE INFORMATION When you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage or network activity information. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device. We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service. We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services. HOW WE USE INFORMATION We use the information we collect with your consent or to provide the Services you request, including for the following purposes. PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Service contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support. For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list, we show that user that you are a user of the Services. If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach. IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services, which may include generative artificial intelligence models. When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity. We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content as part of providing the services you request. Here are some examples: Information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to improve the accuracy of your daily exercise and activity statistics like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled. Based on your sleep data, we may make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep. We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data. COMMUNICATE WITH YOU We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email. PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies. HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below. WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services. You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings. FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys. FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person. Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person. We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity. FOR JOINT PROCESSING OF PROFILE INFORMATION From June 6, 2023, Fitbit users have the opportunity to move their accounts to Google. This means that some Fitbit users will be part of the Google service while others may remain part of the Fitbit service. As a result, to ensure our users can still view their friends lists (including where your friends move their service to Google), Fitbit and Google will share with each other limited profile information about their Fitbit users, notably the user’s name, photo, and friends list. For more information see the JOINT PROCESSING FOR PROFILE INFORMATION section below. YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA We give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below. Accessing and Exporting Data. By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more here. Editing and Deleting Data. By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more here. If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the How Information Is Shared section. Objecting to Data Use. We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time. DATA RETENTION We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the How We Use Information and How Information Is Shared sections. ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services.

Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account. Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at data-protection-office@fitbit.com. INFORMATION SECURITY We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data.

If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Support.

You will learn about the data we collect, how we use it, the controls we give you over your information, and the measures we take to keep it safe. Specifically, we’ll cover: Information We Collect How We Use Information How Information Is Shared Your Rights To Access and Control Your Personal Data Data Retention Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others Our Policies for Children Information Security Our International Operations and Data Transfers European Privacy Disclosures California Privacy Disclosures Changes to This Policy Who We Are and How To Contact Us INFORMATION WE COLLECT When you use our Services, we collect the following types of information, some of which may be considered Consumer Health Data as defined in certain U.S. state laws such as the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US ACCOUNT INFORMATION Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number. This is the only information you have to provide to create an account with us. You may also choose to provide other types of information, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, and community username. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services. You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends. If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message. PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history. If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. LIVE COACHING SERVICES Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES DEVICE INFORMATION Your device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of our various devices and how you can use MobileTrack. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers. GEOLOCATION INFORMATION The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. USAGE INFORMATION When you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage or network activity information. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device. We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service. We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services. HOW WE USE INFORMATION We use the information we collect with your consent or to provide the Services you request, including for the following purposes. PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Service contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support. For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list, we show that user that you are a user of the Services. If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach. IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services, which may include generative artificial intelligence models. When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity. We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content as part of providing the services you request. Here are some examples: Information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to improve the accuracy of your daily exercise and activity statistics like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled. Based on your sleep data, we may make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep. We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data. COMMUNICATE WITH YOU We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email. PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies. HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below. WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services. You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings. FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys. FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person. Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person. We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity. FOR JOINT PROCESSING OF PROFILE INFORMATION From June 6, 2023, Fitbit users have the opportunity to move their accounts to Google. This means that some Fitbit users will be part of the Google service while others may remain part of the Fitbit service. As a result, to ensure our users can still view their friends lists (including where your friends move their service to Google), Fitbit and Google will share with each other limited profile information about their Fitbit users, notably the user’s name, photo, and friends list. For more information see the JOINT PROCESSING FOR PROFILE INFORMATION section below. YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA We give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below. Accessing and Exporting Data. By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more here. Editing and Deleting Data. By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more here. If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the How Information Is Shared section. Objecting to Data Use. We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time. DATA RETENTION We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the How We Use Information and How Information Is Shared sections. ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving advertisements on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those advertisements. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications. To learn more and about your privacy choices, please read our Cookie Use statement. OUR POLICIES FOR CHILDREN We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy. Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account. Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at data-protection-office@fitbit.com. INFORMATION SECURITY We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Support. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy. Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. For a list of the locations where we have offices, please contact us. We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data to third countries around the world. These include the following: 1. Adequacy Decisions European Commission’s, the United Kingdom’s and Switzerland’s Adequacy Decisions. 2.

Fitbit Privacy PolicyLast update: September 16, 2024Note: If you use your Fitbit devices and services with a Google Account, then your data will be handled as described in the Google Privacy Policy, and as explained in more detail in these FAQs on Privacy.

INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US ACCOUNT INFORMATION Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, date of birth, gender, height, weight, and in some cases your mobile telephone number.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services.

If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message. PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history. If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. LIVE COACHING SERVICES Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach.

The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of our various devices and how you can use MobileTrack. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers. GEOLOCATION INFORMATION The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings.

This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device. We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information.

You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service. We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services. HOW WE USE INFORMATION We use the information we collect with your consent or to provide the Services you request, including for the following purposes. PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Service contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support. For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list, we show that user that you are a user of the Services. If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach. IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services, which may include generative artificial intelligence models. When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity. We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content as part of providing the services you request. Here are some examples: Information like your height, weight, gender, and age allows us to improve the accuracy of your daily exercise and activity statistics like the number of calories you burned and the distance you traveled. Based on your sleep data, we may make inferences about your sleeping patterns and provide you with customized insights to help you improve your sleep. We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data. COMMUNICATE WITH YOU We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email. PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies. HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below. WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services. You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings. FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys. FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person. Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person. We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity. FOR JOINT PROCESSING OF PROFILE INFORMATION From June 6, 2023, Fitbit users have the opportunity to move their accounts to Google. This means that some Fitbit users will be part of the Google service while others may remain part of the Fitbit service. As a result, to ensure our users can still view their friends lists (including where your friends move their service to Google), Fitbit and Google will share with each other limited profile information about their Fitbit users, notably the user’s name, photo, and friends list. For more information see the JOINT PROCESSING FOR PROFILE INFORMATION section below. YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA We give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below. Accessing and Exporting Data. By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more here. Editing and Deleting Data. By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more here. If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the How Information Is Shared section. Objecting to Data Use. We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time. DATA RETENTION We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the How We Use Information and How Information Is Shared sections. ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services.

Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account. Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at data-protection-office@fitbit.com. INFORMATION SECURITY We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Support. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy. Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION To help improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services, you may choose to provide us with additional information, like your logs for food, weight, sleep, water, or female health tracking; an alarm; and messages on discussion boards or to your friends on the Services. You may also connect with friends on the Services or invite friends who have not yet joined by providing their email addresses, accessing social networking accounts, or using the contact list on your mobile device. We do not store your contact list and delete it after it is used for adding contacts as friends. If you contact us or participate in a survey, contest, or promotion, we collect the information you submit such as your name, contact information, and message. PAYMENT AND CARD INFORMATION Some Fitbit devices support payments and transactions with third parties. If you activate this feature, you must provide certain information for identification and verification, such as your name, credit, debit or other card number, card expiration date, and CVV code. This information is encrypted and sent to your card network, which upon approval sends back to your device a token, which is a set of random digits for engaging in transactions without exposing your card number. For your convenience, we store the last four digits of your card number and your card issuer’s name and contact information. You can remove the token from your account using your account settings. We do not store your transaction history. If you purchase Fitbit merchandise on our website, you provide your payment information, including your name, credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. We do not store this payment information. We store your shipping address to fulfill your order. Note that third-party payment processors may retain this information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms. LIVE COACHING SERVICES Our live coaching services are a platform for you to communicate with a live health, fitness, or wellness coach (“Live Coaching Services”). Coaches may be provided by third parties, such as your employer or insurance company, or by our third-party coaching service providers. If you use our Live Coaching Services, we collect information about such use, including the plan, goals, and actions you record with your coach, your calendar events, communications with your coach, notes your coach records about you, and other information submitted by you or your coach. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES DEVICE INFORMATION Your device collects data to estimate a variety of metrics like the number of steps you take, your distance traveled, calories burned, weight, heart rate, sleep stages, active minutes, and location. The data collected varies depending on which device you use. Learn more about the features of our various devices and how you can use MobileTrack. When your device syncs with our applications or software, data recorded on your device is transferred from your device to our servers. GEOLOCATION INFORMATION The Services include features that use precise geolocation data, including GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs. We collect this type of data if you grant us access to your location. You can always remove our access using your Fitbit device or mobile device settings. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. USAGE INFORMATION When you access or use our Services, we receive certain usage or network activity information. This includes information about your interaction with the Services, for example, when you view or search content, install applications or software, create or log into your account, pair your device to your account, or open or interact with an application on your Fitbit device. We also collect data about the devices and computers you use to access the Services, including IP addresses, browser type, language, operating system, Fitbit or mobile device information (including device and application identifiers), the referring web page, pages visited, location (depending on the permissions you have granted us), and cookie information. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES If you choose to connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, we may receive information from the other service. For example, if you connect to Facebook or Google, we may receive information like your name, profile picture, age range, language, email address, and friend list. You may also choose to grant us access to your exercise or activity data from another service. You can stop sharing the information from the other service with us by removing our access to that other service. We may partner with third parties, such as employers and insurance companies that offer Fitbit Services to their employees and customers. In such cases, those companies may provide us with your name, email address, or similar information (like a telephone number or subscriber ID) so that we can invite you to participate or determine your eligibility for particular benefits, such as discounts or free services. We use the information we collect with your consent or to provide the Services you request, including for the following purposes. PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THE SERVICES Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Service contract with you. For example, we need to use your information to provide you with your Fitbit dashboard tracking your exercise, activity, and other trends; to enable the community features of the Services; and to give you customer support. For the Services’ community features, we may use your information to help you find and connect with other users and to allow other users to find and connect with you. For example, your account contact information allows other users to add you as a friend. When another user has your email or mobile phone number in their contact list, we show that user that you are a user of the Services. If you use the Live Coaching Services, we use your information to connect you with coaches, allow you to communicate with them through our Services, and help you achieve your goals to lead a healthier, more active life. For example, the goals that you provide allow you to develop a personal plan and set of actions in consultation with your coach. IMPROVE, PERSONALIZE, AND DEVELOP THE SERVICES We use the information we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones. For example, we use the information to troubleshoot and protect against errors; perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; and develop new features and Services, which may include generative artificial intelligence models. When you allow us to collect precise location information, we use that information to provide and improve features of the Services such as recording where a workout took place or mapping an activity. We also use your information to make inferences and show you more relevant content as part of providing the services you request. Here are some examples: We may personalize exercise and activity goals for you based on the goals you previously set and your historical exercise or activity data. COMMUNICATE WITH YOU We use your information when needed to send you Service notifications and respond to you when you contact us. We also use your information to promote new features or products that we think you would be interested in. You can control marketing communications and most Service notifications by using your notification preferences in account settings or via the “Unsubscribe” link in an email. PROMOTE SAFETY AND SECURITY We use the information we collect to promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties. For example, we may use the information to authenticate users, facilitate secure payments, protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies. We never sell the personal information of our users. We do not share your personal information except in the limited circumstances described below. WHEN YOU AGREE OR DIRECT US TO SHARE You may direct us to disclose your information to others, such as when you use our community features like the forums, 7-day leaderboard, and other social tools. For certain information, we provide you with privacy preferences in account settings and other tools to control how your information is visible to other users of the Services. You may also direct us to share your information in other ways, for example, when you give a third-party application access to your account, or give your employer access to information when you choose to participate in an employee wellness program. Remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms. You can revoke your consent to share with third-party applications or employee wellness programs using your account settings. FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING We transfer information to our corporate affiliates, service providers, and other partners who process it for us, based on our instructions, and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. These partners provide us with services globally, including for customer support, information technology, payments, sales, marketing, data analysis, research, and surveys. FOR LEGAL REASONS OR TO PREVENT HARM We may preserve or disclose information about you to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to assert legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to prevent, detect, or investigate illegal activity, fraud, abuse, violations of our terms, or threats to the security of the Services or the physical safety of any person. We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity. FOR JOINT PROCESSING OF PROFILE INFORMATION From June 6, 2023, Fitbit users have the opportunity to move their accounts to Google. This means that some Fitbit users will be part of the Google service while others may remain part of the Fitbit service. As a result, to ensure our users can still view their friends lists (including where your friends move their service to Google), Fitbit and Google will share with each other limited profile information about their Fitbit users, notably the user’s name, photo, and friends list. For more information see the JOINT PROCESSING FOR PROFILE INFORMATION section below. We give you account settings and tools to access and control your personal data, as described below, regardless of where you live. If you live in certain jurisdictions, you may have legal rights with respect to your information, which your account settings and tools allow you to exercise, as outlined below. Accessing and Exporting Data. By logging into your account, you can access much of your personal information, including your dashboard with your daily exercise and activity statistics. Using your account settings, you can also download information in a commonly used file format, including data about your activities, body, foods, and sleep. Learn more here. Editing and Deleting Data. By logging into your account and using your account settings, you can change and delete your personal information. For instance, you can edit or delete the profile data you provide and delete your account if you wish. Learn more here. If you choose to delete your account, please note that while most of your information will be deleted within 30 days, it may take up to 90 days to delete all of your information, like the data recorded by your Fitbit device and other data stored in our backup systems. This is due to the size and complexity of the systems we use to store data. We may also preserve data for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in the How Information Is Shared section. Objecting to Data Use. We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account. You can also use the Fitbit application to unpair your device from your account at any time. We keep your account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account. In some cases, when you give us information for a feature of the Services, we delete the data after it is no longer needed for the feature. For instance, when you provide your contact list for finding friends on the Services, we delete the list after it is used for adding contacts as friends. We keep other information, like your exercise or activity data, until you use your account settings or tools to delete the data or your account because we use this data to provide you with your personal statistics and other aspects of the Services. We also keep information about you and your use of the Services for as long as necessary for our legitimate business interests, for legal reasons, and to prevent harm, including as described in the How We Use Information and How Information Is Shared sections. We work with partners who provide us with analytics and advertising services. This includes helping us understand how users interact with the Services, serving advertisements on our behalf across the internet, and measuring the performance of those advertisements. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites and applications. To learn more and about your privacy choices, please read our Cookie Use statement. We appreciate the importance of taking additional measures to protect children’s privacy. Fitbit allows parents to set up accounts for their children to use with select Fitbit devices (“Children’s Account”). Children’s Accounts are subject to a separate Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts which explains what information we collect to set up these accounts, what information we collect from a child’s use of our Services, and how we use and share that information. Parents or guardians must consent to the use of their child’s data in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Children’s Accounts in order to create such an account. Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, are not permitted to create accounts unless their parent has consented in accordance with applicable law. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the relevant minimum age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents who believe that their child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at data-protection-office@fitbit.com. We work hard to keep your data safe. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt many of our Services. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however. If you have a security-related concern, please contact Customer Support. We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy. Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. For a list of the locations where we have offices, please contact us. We rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data to third countries around the world. These include the following: 1. Adequacy Decisions European Commission’s, the United Kingdom’s and Switzerland’s Adequacy Decisions. 2.

"privacy_policies/Google.Fit.txt","Google.Fit","When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. Privacy Checkup Looking to change your privacy settings? Take the Privacy Checkup We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include: You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us. We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device. We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location. Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include: The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information. In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf. We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs. We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes: We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts. We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center. Go to My Ad Center We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services. We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing. We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public. We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate. We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example. We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy. This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide. Go to Privacy Checkup When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google. We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes: Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services. Go to Activity Controls Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services. Go to My Ad Center Manage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services. Go to About You Choose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads. Go to Shared Endorsements Manage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services. Go to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services My Activity allows you to review and control data that’s saved to your Google Account when you’re signed in and using Google services, like searches you’ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity. Go to My Activity Google Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products. Go to Dashboard Manage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number. Go to Personal Info When you’re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including: You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google. Export your data To delete your information, you can: Delete your information Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account. And finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies. There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including: Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search. When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting. We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases: We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We also provide you with controls to review and manage third party apps and sites you have given access to data in your Google Account. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information. If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to: We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google’s audio recognition technologies. We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected. We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including: You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google. Export your data To delete your information, you can: Delete your information We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings: When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems. You can read more about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information. We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it. We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data. When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly. Some U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information: U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in a portable format; correct your information; and to request that Google delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights. Additionally, the CCPA treats certain kinds of information, like health data, as sensitive; when users provide this information, Google only uses it for purposes permitted by the CCPA, like to provide services that are requested and expected by our users. The Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370 provide specific rights in addition to those rights above, that apply to health information. When you provide this information, Google only processes it with your consent and allows you to withdraw your consent. We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data across Google’s services in Your privacy controls. These tools allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also control what information we use to show you ads, or turn off personalized ads, by visiting My Ad Center. When you use these tools, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re signed in to your Google Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Google. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Google to reconsider it by responding to our email. We also provide more information on Google’s handling of CCPA requests. Some U.S. state privacy laws also require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy. Identifiers and similar information such as your name and password, phone number, and address, as well as unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. Some Google services like YouTube Studio provide the option to submit a valid ID (such as a passport or driver’s license) to verify your identity to use additional features.

Professional, employment, and education information, such as information you provide or that is maintained through an organization using Google services at which you study or work. Other information you create or provide, such as the content you create, upload, or receive (like photos and videos or emails, docs and spreadsheets). Google Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products. Inferences drawn from the above, like your ads interest categories. Protecting against security threats, abuse, and illegal activity: Google uses and may disclose information to detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, and for protecting against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity. For example, to protect our services, Google may receive or disclose information about IP addresses that malicious actors have compromised. Auditing and measurement: Google uses information for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used, as well as to fulfill obligations to our partners like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. We may disclose non-personally identifiable information publicly and with these partners, including for auditing purposes. Maintaining our services: Google uses information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting bugs and other issues that you report to us. Research and development: Google uses information to improve our services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, we use publicly available information to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Use of service providers: Google shares information with service providers to perform services on our behalf, in compliance with our Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we may rely on service providers to help provide customer support. Advertising: Google processes information to provide advertising, including online identifiers, browsing and search activity, and information about your location and interactions with advertisements. This keeps Google’s services and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center. Legal reasons: Google also uses information to satisfy applicable laws or regulations, and discloses information in response to legal process or enforceable government requests, including to law enforcement.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google LLC and its affiliates, including YouTube, Android, and services offered on third-party sites, such as advertising services. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to: We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the last changes were published and we offer access to archived versions for your review. If changes are significant, we’ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). The following privacy notices provide additional information about some Google services: If you’re a member of an organization that uses Google Workspace or Google Cloud Platform, learn how these services collect and use your personal information in the Google Cloud Privacy Notice. The following links highlight useful resources for you to learn more about our practices and privacy settings. An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Ltd, Google Payment Corp, and Google Dialer Inc. Learn more about the companies providing business services in the EU. A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations. An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content. Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in ""local storage"" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps. A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices. You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings. Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information. This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user. This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies. A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited. This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality. Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this: A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed. Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies. On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services. If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account’s Web & App Activity. Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service. When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people. This helps protect your privacy. In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches. You can view and control your Web & App Activity at My Activity. Websites and apps that integrate Google services like ads and analytics share information with us. This information is collected regardless of which browser or browser mode you use. For example, although Incognito mode in Chrome can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device, third party sites and apps that integrate our services may still share information with Google when you visit them. You can learn more about some of the ways you can control the information that is shared when you visit or interact with sites and apps that use Google services. For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads. For example, merchants may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can include loyalty information in search or shopping results, or better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people. Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services. For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization. Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include: When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities. For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account. For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads. For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly. If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report. For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone. Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more. There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this. We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more Learn more about the technologies used for advertising. You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more You might choose to save places to your Google Account that are important to you, such as your home or your work. If you set your home or work addresses, they can be used to help you do things more easily, such as getting directions or finding results closer to your home or work, and for ads. You can edit or delete your home or work addresses anytime in your Google Account. For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account). For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Gemini Apps, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services. For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include: When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services. Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel. Learn more about how we use location information. For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users. Examples of these services include: When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store. For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information. Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently. For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices. For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you. These laws include: Depending on your available settings, some examples of how we use the information we collect across our services include: For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears. For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information. Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.

This Privacy Policy does not limit any of your rights you may have pursuant to mandatory applicable privacy regulation. Harald AI Privacy Policy 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Responsible entity 1.1.1 Harald AI Oy, address Tekniikantie 12, 02150 Espoo, Finland, Business ID 2913702-7 (“Harald AI”), is the stated responsible entity under the data protection regulations. In other words, we are the data controller that decides on the purpose and means of processing the personal data of our users (“User Data”) and are therefore responsible for ensuring that personal data is processed in compliance with the applicable laws. 1.1.2 As the responsible entity we are subject, for example, to information requirements that we wish to fulfill in connection with this Privacy Policy. We also provide additional information within our products, e.g., we may ask you for a new consent or explain the consequences of revocating previously given consent. The information in our products does not contradict this Privacy Policy, but rather supplements it with brief and easily readable information so that you can make decisions more easily. This Privacy Policy and the additional information are easily accessible at any time from within our products. 1.2 Structure and consent concept 1.2.1 This Privacy Policy informs you about the purposes and scope of processing your User Data, as well as data transfers, and your extensive data protection rights. As our products are exclusively aimed at persons with diabetes, your use typically already provides information on your health condition. We therefore only process your health data if you have given your consent. We differentiate as follows: 1.2.1.1 “Necessary Processing” describes how we process the User Data required to fulfill the contract. Without this processing the use of our products is not possible from a legal and a factual point of view because our services depend on this processing. When User Data includes medical data, we additionally ask for your explicit consent to process this data. 1.2.1.2 “Processing for Product Improvement” explains how you can help us and other users, with your consent, by allowing us to use your data to develop algorithms for blood sugar prediction, improve the product and so forth without us contacting you for advertising purposes etc. 1.2.1.3 “Processing for Marketing Purposes” describes how we contact you for marketing purposes, with your consent, e.g., by email, notifications etc. 1.2.1.4 In “General Information” we have assembled the information that applies to all the above consents to avoid repetition.The relevant categories are described in more detail below. You may provide the relevant consents upon registration or later via the account settings. You may revoke any consents at any time via the account settings or by sending an email to hello@happybob.app. In such an instance we will inform you about the consequences of the revocation. The lawfulness of the processing prior to revocation remains unaffected. 1.2.2 In some cases, the processing may take place independently of consent on the basis of statutory principles (e.g., medical device regulations). We will inform you accordingly in appropriate cases. 2. NECESSARY PROCESSING When you register to use Happy Bob App, we process the User Data listed below to be able to provide our services, i.e., to fulfill a contract. User Data that includes your medical data is processed when you grant your explicit consent for processing it. If you do not consent to this necessary processing, we are unable to provide you the services of Harald AI. You may provide your consents during the registration process and manage them in the account settings. 2.1 Necessary User Data 2.1.1 In order to protect your User Data, our services can only be used in connection with a user account. To create a user account and to use Happy Bob App we require and process the following User Data:● First name● Last name● Email address● Password● Registration date● Continuous Glucose Monitor you use● Status of consents● Device ID, manufacturer● Device type, operating system version● Language, country, time zone We also collect Commercial and Usage DataApp store download, device ID, operating system, browser type and version, token, activity events for customization, support queries. Medical DataBlood glucose reading and sensor data such as sensor value, time and time zone. We may receive medical data manually directly from you or with your authorization directly through a third-party API from a continuous glucose monitor. 2.1.2 If you wish, you can operate the user account under an assumed name (pseudonym), i.e. you do not have to state your real name. You can also enter any email address that you set up especially for us – however it must work so that we can send you important warnings. The scope of the data recorded by Harald AI depends on your registration and use of our products. We only process the User Data that you actively and voluntarily provide to Harald AI. The entry of requested User Data is however a requirement for the comprehensive use of our products. 2.2 Necessary purposes 2.2.1 All the necessary purposes of our processing are associated with providing our services:Use of our Happy Bob App leads to technical and device-related data recordings such as the device ID, location and use behavior data. The legal basis for processing this data is our legitimate interest to improve your user experience (e.g. by enabling the Happy Hob App to remember choices you have made while using the App) and to prevent any misuse of our Products (e.g. to ensure that certain functions are available only in specific areas). Registration leads to the creation of your user account using the email address and password. The legal basis for this is the performance of a contract so that we may provide you with our Products you have requested from us. The provision of our services requires you to voluntarily provide us CGM data. When you provide us manually with your CGM data, the legal basis is your explicit consent and the performance of a contract between us as our Happy Bob App would not work without your CGM data. Communication from Harald AI with you within our Happy Bob App or via other electronic messaging services (e.g. email) where this is required to support or troubleshoot our products. This is how we process any comments and queries that you may have via various communication channels when using Happy Bob App. Please therefore think about which information and data you want to give in your active communication with us – this is solely your decision. When you provide us your contact details and other information in connection of communicating with our customer service, the legal basis for processing that personal data is our legitimate interest to serve you and/or our legal obligations e.g. in relation to fulfilling your rights as a data subject. We may conduct clinical studies or research alone or with our partners as we are committed to the science of all aspects of diabetes and determining and improving effectiveness of techniques for controlling and treating diabetes. For this we or our relevant partner will always acquire your explicit consent. 3. PROCESSING FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT We also process your User Data to improve our products and services as described in more detail below. In these instances, the processing is based on our legitimate interest to develop and improve the Happy Bob App and to ensure that it is safe to use. 3.1 Usage Data Activity events that allow us to understand how you use our products. This enables us to see how our products are used and for example where menu designs can be optimized. 3.2 Other Data We also ask users information about their country, diabetes type, gender and age. This data is used to analyze which user groups benefit from the Happy Bob use. 3.2 Purpose of product improvement As a result of fast-moving technological progress, we have to continually analyze, develop, test, and improve our products and their interactions, in order to ensure that our content benefits users in the most effective way. To achieve this, we conduct usage and security tests and the knowledge gained is incorporated into improved new versions of our products such as the app. These improvements are also provided to you via regular updates. 4. PROCESSING FOR MARKETING PURPOSES 4.1 Newsletter 4.1.1 We would like to send you interesting information on products and services in addition to the contractual scope (including information from carefully selected partners) and invitations to participate in surveys or other sales promotions and marketing activities (“Newsletter”). 4.1.2 You can select whether you want to subscribe to our Newsletter (opt in) i.e. this processing is based on your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via the link in the Newsletter or the account settings. 4.2 Other types of marketing 4.2.1 Other consents, e.g., for surveys or notifications are obtained as required when you are logged in. We always explain to you why we need certain data and how you can revoke the consent. 5. USAGE FOR STATUTORY PURPOSES 5.1. Enforcement of rights and disclosures required by law The use of personal data may also be necessary to prevent abuse by users or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. We may be forced into disclosure due to binding laws, court or official decisions and instructions, criminal investigation, or in the public interest. 6. GENERAL INFORMATION 6.1 Purpose limitation and security 6.1.1 Harald AI uses your personal data exclusively for the purposes determined in this Privacy Policy and the relevant consents. We ensure that each processing is restricted to the extent necessary for its purpose. 6.1.2 Each processing always guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of your personal data. This covers protection from unauthorized and illegal processing, unintentional loss, unintentional destruction or damage using appropriate technical and organizational measures. We use strict internal processes, security features, and encryption methods. 6.2 Processors 6.2.1 Our products are subject to complex processes that we have to manage and keep up-to-date. For technical support we may use affiliated companies and third-party suppliers (“Processors”) in order to offer you a comprehensive and optimal use of our product. 6.2.2 Harald AI transfers User Data to Processors exclusively within the framework of this Privacy Policy and only to fulfill the purposes stated in it. Processors work according to our specifications and instructions; they are not permitted to use the personal data of our users for their own or other purposes. 6.2.3 We use Processors offering sufficient guarantees that suitable technical and organizational measures are undertaken in a way that the processing of personal data complies with the statutory requirements and our Privacy Policy. The protection of the rights of our users is ensured by concluding binding contracts that meet the strict requirements of GDPR. 6.2.4 The third-party suppliers appointed by Harald AI may only use other processors (subcontractors) with our prior consent. If a subcontractor does not comply with the same data protection obligations and all the appropriate security measures that we impose on our Processors, then we will prohibit the hiring of such a subcontractor. 6.3 Encryption, pseudonymization, and anonymization 6.3.1 Each data transfer, without exception and by default, is encrypted during transfer. Using HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) we ensure that your data is not intercepted by unauthorized third parties. In addition, for the purposes of data security and minimization, we also use other processes for the encryption and pseudonymization of User Data. Of course, this depends on the type, scope, and purpose of the relevant data processing. For example, we only disclose User Data that a Processor requires to carry out his tasks. 6.3.2 When a contractual relationship with a Processor is terminated, such Processor must, at Harald AI’s discretion, either return all our User’s Data or delete it if there are no statutory storage obligations. 6.3.3 Data that requires no personal reference for processing (e.g. for research and analysis) is subject to anonymization. This prevents a connection to a specific user being made in all cases. 6.4 Location of our partners and suppliers 6.4.1 If you are located in the EU/EEA, Switzerland or Canada, we primarily select cooperation partners who are based in or whose servers are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). 6.4.2 We may appoint third-party suppliers who are located in or who have servers outside the EU. In these cases, your personal data is subject to a high protection level in line with the GDPR – either through an EU adequacy decision or through certain standard contractual clauses approved by the EU, which the contractual relationships with our contracted data processors are based on, or through comparable legal instruments permitted under the GDPR. In any case, all Processors are subject to the obligations in this Privacy Policy and we use industry standard methods and protocols for encrypting data in transit. If you need more information, please reach out to us at privacy@happybob.app. 6.4.3 If you are located in the US, we will only process your data within the US and select our partners for processing of your data accordingly. See also section 6.8 below. 6.5 Categories of recipients 6.5.1 Our cooperation partners are bound by the agreements signed with Harald AI as well as by the GDPR and only process data according to our instructions.

Access and Data when Acting as a Business Associate to a HIPAA Covered Entity You may receive access to Happy Bob through your health care provider or health insurance. Both types of organizations are considered Covered Entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In this case, our data use and protection activities will comply with HIPAA. In this case, we will be required to follow the laws and regulations related to HIPAA and our agreement with your health care provider or insurer. Thus, in this case, your data and all data collected via Happy Bob will be considered personal health information (PHI) and as such we will comply with HIPAA and your rights under HIPAA. For the sake of this conversion, we will collect and maintain all the same data elements from you when we function as either a Business Associate to a Covered Entity under HIPAA in which case all data we collect is considered PHI, or when we have an independent user-relationship with you and the data is considered to be your personal data. Any data that is collected or entered on your health status by a health care provider or clinical staff under this arrangement will be retained by your medical clinic and available via request pursuant to HIPAA rules and regulations from your treating providers through which you engaged with Happy Bob for the first time. This data will be shared with your health care provider or insurer for the purpose of your health care services. It will be retained by your covered entity and Happy Bob for the purposes of complying with HIPAA. In the event you are no longer receiving care from the Covered Entity which you originally received Happy Bob, your account will be converted from a Covered Entity account to a general Happy Bob account. Going forward from this point of transition, your data will be subject to this privacy policy and the terms and conditions of use in the mobile application. This data will no longer be considered PHI as it is no longer collected and stored for the purpose of providing medical services by a covered entity. If you opt for additional covered services provided through Happy Bob or through another participating Covered Entity, your account may be recreated or reclassified as a Covered Entity account again. This transition will occur upon notification from either you, the user, or from your contracted Covered Entity. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE IN US! Privacy Policy Jan 16, 2025 Thank you for visiting the Happy Bob website, https://happybob.app, which is hosted and operated by Harald AI Oy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and handle information and personally identifiable data about our users when they access and use our website and Happy Bob App. We collect and process all your data in compliance with applicable privacy legislation including the GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA and PIPEDA. This Privacy Policy does not limit any of your rights you may have pursuant to mandatory applicable privacy regulation. Harald AI Privacy Policy 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Responsible entity 1.1.1 Harald AI Oy, address Tekniikantie 12, 02150 Espoo, Finland, Business ID 2913702-7 (“Harald AI”), is the stated responsible entity under the data protection regulations. In other words, we are the data controller that decides on the purpose and means of processing the personal data of our users (“User Data”) and are therefore responsible for ensuring that personal data is processed in compliance with the applicable laws. 1.1.2 As the responsible entity we are subject, for example, to information requirements that we wish to fulfill in connection with this Privacy Policy. We also provide additional information within our products, e.g., we may ask you for a new consent or explain the consequences of revocating previously given consent. The information in our products does not contradict this Privacy Policy, but rather supplements it with brief and easily readable information so that you can make decisions more easily. This Privacy Policy and the additional information are easily accessible at any time from within our products. 1.2 Structure and consent concept 1.2.1 This Privacy Policy informs you about the purposes and scope of processing your User Data, as well as data transfers, and your extensive data protection rights. As our products are exclusively aimed at persons with diabetes, your use typically already provides information on your health condition. We therefore only process your health data if you have given your consent. We differentiate as follows: 1.2.1.1 “Necessary Processing” describes how we process the User Data required to fulfill the contract. Without this processing the use of our products is not possible from a legal and a factual point of view because our services depend on this processing. When User Data includes medical data, we additionally ask for your explicit consent to process this data. 1.2.1.2 “Processing for Product Improvement” explains how you can help us and other users, with your consent, by allowing us to use your data to develop algorithms for blood sugar prediction, improve the product and so forth without us contacting you for advertising purposes etc. 1.2.1.3 “Processing for Marketing Purposes” describes how we contact you for marketing purposes, with your consent, e.g., by email, notifications etc. 1.2.1.4 In “General Information” we have assembled the information that applies to all the above consents to avoid repetition.The relevant categories are described in more detail below. You may provide the relevant consents upon registration or later via the account settings. You may revoke any consents at any time via the account settings or by sending an email to hello@happybob.app. In such an instance we will inform you about the consequences of the revocation. The lawfulness of the processing prior to revocation remains unaffected. 1.2.2 In some cases, the processing may take place independently of consent on the basis of statutory principles (e.g., medical device regulations). We will inform you accordingly in appropriate cases. 2. NECESSARY PROCESSING When you register to use Happy Bob App, we process the User Data listed below to be able to provide our services, i.e., to fulfill a contract. User Data that includes your medical data is processed when you grant your explicit consent for processing it. If you do not consent to this necessary processing, we are unable to provide you the services of Harald AI. You may provide your consents during the registration process and manage them in the account settings. 2.1 Necessary User Data 2.1.1 In order to protect your User Data, our services can only be used in connection with a user account. To create a user account and to use Happy Bob App we require and process the following User Data:● First name● Last name● Email address● Password● Registration date● Continuous Glucose Monitor you use● Status of consents● Device ID, manufacturer● Device type, operating system version● Language, country, time zone We also collect Commercial and Usage DataApp store download, device ID, operating system, browser type and version, token, activity events for customization, support queries. Medical DataBlood glucose reading and sensor data such as sensor value, time and time zone. We may receive medical data manually directly from you or with your authorization directly through a third-party API from a continuous glucose monitor. 2.1.2 If you wish, you can operate the user account under an assumed name (pseudonym), i.e. you do not have to state your real name. You can also enter any email address that you set up especially for us – however it must work so that we can send you important warnings. The scope of the data recorded by Harald AI depends on your registration and use of our products. We only process the User Data that you actively and voluntarily provide to Harald AI. The entry of requested User Data is however a requirement for the comprehensive use of our products. 2.2 Necessary purposes 2.2.1 All the necessary purposes of our processing are associated with providing our services:Use of our Happy Bob App leads to technical and device-related data recordings such as the device ID, location and use behavior data. The legal basis for processing this data is our legitimate interest to improve your user experience (e.g. by enabling the Happy Hob App to remember choices you have made while using the App) and to prevent any misuse of our Products (e.g. to ensure that certain functions are available only in specific areas). Registration leads to the creation of your user account using the email address and password. The legal basis for this is the performance of a contract so that we may provide you with our Products you have requested from us. The provision of our services requires you to voluntarily provide us CGM data. When you provide us manually with your CGM data, the legal basis is your explicit consent and the performance of a contract between us as our Happy Bob App would not work without your CGM data. Communication from Harald AI with you within our Happy Bob App or via other electronic messaging services (e.g. email) where this is required to support or troubleshoot our products. This is how we process any comments and queries that you may have via various communication channels when using Happy Bob App. Please therefore think about which information and data you want to give in your active communication with us – this is solely your decision. When you provide us your contact details and other information in connection of communicating with our customer service, the legal basis for processing that personal data is our legitimate interest to serve you and/or our legal obligations e.g. in relation to fulfilling your rights as a data subject. We may conduct clinical studies or research alone or with our partners as we are committed to the science of all aspects of diabetes and determining and improving effectiveness of techniques for controlling and treating diabetes. For this we or our relevant partner will always acquire your explicit consent. 3. PROCESSING FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT We also process your User Data to improve our products and services as described in more detail below. In these instances, the processing is based on our legitimate interest to develop and improve the Happy Bob App and to ensure that it is safe to use. 3.1 Usage Data Activity events that allow us to understand how you use our products. This enables us to see how our products are used and for example where menu designs can be optimized. 3.2 Other Data We also ask users information about their country, diabetes type, gender and age. This data is used to analyze which user groups benefit from the Happy Bob use. 3.2 Purpose of product improvement As a result of fast-moving technological progress, we have to continually analyze, develop, test, and improve our products and their interactions, in order to ensure that our content benefits users in the most effective way. To achieve this, we conduct usage and security tests and the knowledge gained is incorporated into improved new versions of our products such as the app. These improvements are also provided to you via regular updates. 4. PROCESSING FOR MARKETING PURPOSES 4.1 Newsletter 4.1.1 We would like to send you interesting information on products and services in addition to the contractual scope (including information from carefully selected partners) and invitations to participate in surveys or other sales promotions and marketing activities (“Newsletter”). 4.1.2 You can select whether you want to subscribe to our Newsletter (opt in) i.e. this processing is based on your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via the link in the Newsletter or the account settings. 4.2 Other types of marketing 4.2.1 Other consents, e.g., for surveys or notifications are obtained as required when you are logged in. We always explain to you why we need certain data and how you can revoke the consent. 5. USAGE FOR STATUTORY PURPOSES 5.1. Enforcement of rights and disclosures required by law The use of personal data may also be necessary to prevent abuse by users or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. We may be forced into disclosure due to binding laws, court or official decisions and instructions, criminal investigation, or in the public interest. 6. GENERAL INFORMATION 6.1 Purpose limitation and security 6.1.1 Harald AI uses your personal data exclusively for the purposes determined in this Privacy Policy and the relevant consents. We ensure that each processing is restricted to the extent necessary for its purpose. 6.1.2 Each processing always guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of your personal data. This covers protection from unauthorized and illegal processing, unintentional loss, unintentional destruction or damage using appropriate technical and organizational measures. We use strict internal processes, security features, and encryption methods. 6.2 Processors 6.2.1 Our products are subject to complex processes that we have to manage and keep up-to-date. For technical support we may use affiliated companies and third-party suppliers (“Processors”) in order to offer you a comprehensive and optimal use of our product. 6.2.2 Harald AI transfers User Data to Processors exclusively within the framework of this Privacy Policy and only to fulfill the purposes stated in it. Processors work according to our specifications and instructions; they are not permitted to use the personal data of our users for their own or other purposes. 6.2.3 We use Processors offering sufficient guarantees that suitable technical and organizational measures are undertaken in a way that the processing of personal data complies with the statutory requirements and our Privacy Policy. The protection of the rights of our users is ensured by concluding binding contracts that meet the strict requirements of GDPR. 6.2.4 The third-party suppliers appointed by Harald AI may only use other processors (subcontractors) with our prior consent. If a subcontractor does not comply with the same data protection obligations and all the appropriate security measures that we impose on our Processors, then we will prohibit the hiring of such a subcontractor. 6.3 Encryption, pseudonymization, and anonymization 6.3.1 Each data transfer, without exception and by default, is encrypted during transfer. Using HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) we ensure that your data is not intercepted by unauthorized third parties. In addition, for the purposes of data security and minimization, we also use other processes for the encryption and pseudonymization of User Data. Of course, this depends on the type, scope, and purpose of the relevant data processing. For example, we only disclose User Data that a Processor requires to carry out his tasks. 6.3.2 When a contractual relationship with a Processor is terminated, such Processor must, at Harald AI’s discretion, either return all our User’s Data or delete it if there are no statutory storage obligations. 6.3.3 Data that requires no personal reference for processing (e.g. for research and analysis) is subject to anonymization. This prevents a connection to a specific user being made in all cases. 6.4 Location of our partners and suppliers 6.4.1 If you are located in the EU/EEA, Switzerland or Canada, we primarily select cooperation partners who are based in or whose servers are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). 6.4.2 We may appoint third-party suppliers who are located in or who have servers outside the EU. In these cases, your personal data is subject to a high protection level in line with the GDPR – either through an EU adequacy decision or through certain standard contractual clauses approved by the EU, which the contractual relationships with our contracted data processors are based on, or through comparable legal instruments permitted under the GDPR. In any case, all Processors are subject to the obligations in this Privacy Policy and we use industry standard methods and protocols for encrypting data in transit. If you need more information, please reach out to us at privacy@happybob.app. 6.4.3 If you are located in the US, we will only process your data within the US and select our partners for processing of your data accordingly. See also section 6.8 below. 6.5 Categories of recipients 6.5.1 Our cooperation partners are bound by the agreements signed with Harald AI as well as by the GDPR and only process data according to our instructions. We provide our users’ Data only to fulfill the contract. Customer support services and their tools help our customer support to handle our users’ inquiries quickly and efficiently. Here, for example, queries are recorded from various communication channels and grouped according to topics using ticket systems. Analysis service providers and their tools help us to understand how users use our products in order for us to provide customized communication and product improvements in the future. Marketing service providers support us in creating, sorting, customizing, and sending newsletters, emails, and other messages about our products to our users. Hosting and cloud services and their tools are used to store data and to produce anonymized analyses (see section 2.4 above). 6.6 Cookies Harald AI stores so-called “cookies” to provide our website and make the use of it more convenient.

(“Google”).Google Universal Analytics uses cookies (see above) to enable analysis of your website use. The information generated by the cookie on your use of our website is generally transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA.

Access and Data when Acting as a Business Associate to a HIPAA Covered Entity You may receive access to Happy Bob through your health care provider or health insurance. Both types of organizations are considered Covered Entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In this case, our data use and protection activities will comply with HIPAA. In this case, we will be required to follow the laws and regulations related to HIPAA and our agreement with your health care provider or insurer. Thus, in this case, your data and all data collected via Happy Bob will be considered personal health information (PHI) and as such we will comply with HIPAA and your rights under HIPAA. For the sake of this conversion, we will collect and maintain all the same data elements from you when we function as either a Business Associate to a Covered Entity under HIPAA in which case all data we collect is considered PHI, or when we have an independent user-relationship with you and the data is considered to be your personal data. Any data that is collected or entered on your health status by a health care provider or clinical staff under this arrangement will be retained by your medical clinic and available via request pursuant to HIPAA rules and regulations from your treating providers through which you engaged with Happy Bob for the first time. This data will be shared with your health care provider or insurer for the purpose of your health care services. It will be retained by your covered entity and Happy Bob for the purposes of complying with HIPAA. In the event you are no longer receiving care from the Covered Entity which you originally received Happy Bob, your account will be converted from a Covered Entity account to a general Happy Bob account. Going forward from this point of transition, your data will be subject to this privacy policy and the terms and conditions of use in the mobile application. This data will no longer be considered PHI as it is no longer collected and stored for the purpose of providing medical services by a covered entity. If you opt for additional covered services provided through Happy Bob or through another participating Covered Entity, your account may be recreated or reclassified as a Covered Entity account again. This transition will occur upon notification from either you, the user, or from your contracted Covered Entity. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE IN US!

Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section above. 8) Changes to This Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy is current as of the “Last Updated” date set forth above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our Site and App. For residents covered under the State Privacy Laws, this U.S. State Privacy Notice supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy by providing additional information under such laws. The term “State Privacy Laws” means, as applicable, the U.S. state privacy laws that govern the processing of consumers’ personal information generally (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Colorado Privacy Act, Oregon Consumer Privacy Act), as opposed to sector-specific laws (e.g., HIPAA). For clarity, this U.S. State Privacy Notice also does not apply to protected health information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Once you create an account to become a patient, use the K Pharmacy services or otherwise use the services of any other member of our Organized Health Care Arrangement (“OHCA”), all personal information you provide to us through your account while using the Services is subject to the OHCA’s joint HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices. Depending on your state of residency, you may exercise the following rights under the State Privacy Laws in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected about you (subject to certain limitations under such laws, such as exceptions in the State Privacy Laws or the inability to verify your identity): To submit a request to exercise your right to access, deletion, or correction please email [email protected]. You may also call us at 888-564-5250 for assistance on exercising rights requests (where State Privacy Laws require that we provide another means for such assistance). To exercise your right to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” and “targeted advertising,” please click our Your Privacy Choices link (found in the Site footer) and follow the instructions therein. You may also visit our Site with the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal enabled to opt-out of “sales/shares/targeted advertising” (learn more about GPC at www.globalprivacycontrol.org). The “sale/share/targeted advertising” opt-out is on a per-website basis and applies at the browser level for the device you use to opt out. Unless otherwise prohibited by the State Privacy Laws, we may need to verify your identity and confirm your residency before processing your request. In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, phone number, or date of last transaction on our Services. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your personal information in our systems. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You have the right to not receive “discriminatory” treatment for exercising the rights discussed in the table above. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner. Further, under certain State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request. All appeals should be submitted by emailing [email protected] along with a copy of the decision that you are appealing. In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), to the extent we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. For requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we may require the following for verification purposes: For requests to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” or the processing of your personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, we may require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf. Where we process “deidentified information” (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law. The following additional disclosures are part of the U.S. State Privacy Notice but apply only to residents covered under the CCPA. Please see the list below for the categories of personal information we have collected in the last 12 months. Further, please see “How We Use the Personal Information We Collect” for the purposes for which such personal information is used. In the previous 12 months, we may have “sold” and “shared” the following categories of personal information to our advertising/marketing and analytics partners for the purposes of advertising/marketing and analytics services, subject to your right to opt-out via our Your Privacy Choices link (found in the Site footer): identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, sensitive personal information, and internet or other network information. We retain the categories of personal information above as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In many situations, we must obtain all, or a portion, of your personal information to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, protect against fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal activity, or for another one of our business purposes.

OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising. Lose It! may display ads on both the Services and on the Channels. We may use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels. The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change. For a list of some of the applicable providers, contact us at privacy@everydayhealth.com. For more details about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, click here. For more details about OBA and opting out, see Interest Based Advertising below.

We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests. We store page views, clicks, and search terms used for ad personalization, targeting separately from your Personal Information. We may share de-identified data segments with third parties, and where we do, we implement technical measures and contractual requirements to prevent identification. Web Beacons. We may also use web beacons, clear gif technology, or action tags as mechanisms to collect aggregate site visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and through our Websites. We may also use this technology to track the delivery of HTML email messages. Data collected through this mechanism is not linked to personal information. A web beacon is an electronic image and string of code that is embedded in a web page or email which allows us to track web page views/hits or the opening of an email containing a beacon. We may use web beacon in conjunction with cookies to track web-site activity on www.loseit.com.

We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events.

For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels. The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change. For a list of some of the applicable providers, contact us at privacy@everydayhealth.com.

We may share de-identified data segments with third parties, and where we do, we implement technical measures and contractual requirements to prevent identification. Web Beacons.

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Always Together we have a few fundamental principles: Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team. Like most internet-service operators, Always Together collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, apps, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Always Together’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Always Together’s visitors use its website/app. Always Together also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that use the services and visitors. Certain visitors to Always Together’s websites and users of Always Together’s apps choose to interact with Always Together in ways that require Always Together to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Always Together gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users of our app to provide a phone number. In each case, Always Together collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Always Together. Always Together does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain product-related activities. Health and Activity data gathered as part of the fulfilment of the purpose of the platform (e.g. Steps and Workouts data from all sources connected to us such as Google Fit or Apple Health) will be stored securely and only shared with 3rd parties that facilitate the better working of the platform (e.g. analytics platform) and other users whom the data providing user explicitly approves (e.g. joining a team with friends). Motion accesses only the data required for operation of services directly available to the user. This includes: Personal bio info is never shared with other users, and is NOT collected from Health Connect. We only collect Steps, Workouts, and distance data from the user and this data is stored in on encrypted servers and only shared according to the above, with the explicit permission of the user. We read users daily/weekly steps, as well as user Sessions(workouts) added to Google Fit storage by other third party apps. Each Session is being read with basic details that let us add those values to their total weekly progress, as outlined above. You can choose to connect and share your information with Health connect, and your Health Connect information with Motion. The use of information received from Health Connect will adhere to the Health Connect permissions policy, including the Limited use requirements. Always Together may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites/apps.

Quest will not discriminate against any consumer because such person exercised any of the consumer’s rights under these privacy laws, including, but not limited to: Quest may, however, charge a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is related to the value of your data. To make a request to exercise your privacy rights you may visit our online request form. You may also call (833) 341-0196. To exercise your right to appeal, you may email us at privacy@questdiagnostics.com and include the Request ID from your previous request. Certain state residents may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We will comply with requests made by authorized agents as required by applicable law. We will deny requests from agents that do not submit proof of authorization from you. To verify that an authorized agent has authority to act for you, we may require a copy of a power of attorney or require that you provide the authorized agent with written permission and verify your own identity with us. We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed above. We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need additional time to respond, up to another 45 days, but we will reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we need an extension, we will explain why. For certain types of requests, we may need to verify your identity. In those cases, you will need to provide us with certain information such as your name, email address, physical address, or other information, as relevant, so that we can verify that you are who you say you are. Which information may depend on the type and sensitivity of information requested. In certain cases, we may deny a request. For example, we may deny a request if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you the information could create an unreasonable risk to someone’s security (for example, we do not want very sensitive information disclosed inappropriately), or we may deny a request for deletion if the law requires that we maintain the information (e.g., to comply with federal and state medical record retention requirements); or, if we need the information for internal purposes such as to continue to provide you services. If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it.

"privacy_policies/MySugr.txt","MySugr","1.1.1 mySugr GmbH, located in Vienna at the business address Trattnerhof 1/5 OG, 1010 Vienna and registered in the Company Register of Vienna Commercial Court under FN 376086 v (“mySugr”), is the stated responsible entity under the data protection regulations. In other words we are the company that decides on the purpose and means of processing the personal data of our users (“User Data”) and is therefore responsible for its security and compliance with the applicable laws. 1.1.2 As the responsible entity we are subject, for example, to information requirements that we wish to fulfill in connection with this privacy notice. We also provide additional information within our products, e.g. we may ask you for a new consent or explain the consequences of revocation. The information in our products does not contradict this privacy notice, but rather supplements it with brief and easily readable information so that you can make decisions more easily. This privacy notice and the additional information are easily accessible at any time from within our products. 1.2.1 This privacy notice informs you about the purposes and scope of processing your User Data, as well as data transfers, and your extensive rights. As our offer is exclusively aimed at persons with diabetes, your use typically already provides information on your health condition. We therefore only process User Data as health data with your consent. We differentiate as follows: 1.2.1.1 “Necessary Processing” describes how we process the User Data required to fulfill the contract. Without this consent the use of our products is not possible from a legal and a factual point of view because our services depend on this processing. 1.2.1.2 “Processing for Product Improvement” explains how you can help us and other users, with your consent, by allowing us to use your data in particular to develop algorithms for therapy management, improve the product and so forth without us contacting you for advertising purposes etc. You can also use the products without giving us this consent - but your consent improves the database in the interest of all users so that we can improve our product more quickly. 1.2.1.3 “Processing for Marketing Purposes” describes how we contact you for marketing purposes, with your consent, e.g. by email, notifications etc. Here too you may use the products without consent but with your consent you will receive interesting information on our products or if, for example, your health insurance company covers new services. 1.2.1.4 In “General Information” we have assembled the information that applies to all of the above consents to avoid repetition. The relevant categories are described in more detail below. You may provide the relevant consents upon registration or later via the account settings. You may revoke any consents at any time via the account settings or by sending an email to support@mysugr.com. In such an instance we will inform you about the consequences of the revocation. The lawfulness of the processing prior to revocation remains unaffected. 1.2.2 In some cases, the processing may take place independently of consent on the basis of statutory principles (e.g. medical device regulations). We will inform you accordingly in appropriate cases. If you grant your consent, we process the User Data listed below in order to be able to provide our services. If you do not consent to this necessary processing, you cannot use the services of mySugr. You may provide your consents during the registration process and manage them in the account settings. 2.1.1 In order to protect your User Data, our services can only be used in connection with a user account. To create a user account we require and process the following User Data: 2.1.2 All other information is optional and self-explanatory in the input masks. Such optional entries include: Personal Master Data: first name, last name, address, date of birth/age, gender, telephone number. Medical Master Data: diabetes type, diagnosis year, insulin therapy (pen/pump), blood glucose target range, height, weight, meter/therapy device, medication, type of insulin, basal settings, correction factors, carbs / insulin ratio. Commercial and Usage Data App store download, purchase, invoices, payment status, payment method (credit card, bank account, etc.) insurance number, mySugr Pro status, vouchers redeemed, IP address, device ID, operating system, browser type and version, token, activity events for customization, support queries. Medical Data App entries such as date/time/time zone/place, type and duration of activities (breakfast, office work, sport etc.), food intake/meal/ingredients, pills taken/injections, blood glucose measurements, notes/text, blood pressure, weight, HbA1c, ketones, steps, images/photos, medication, tags, points, imported values; sensor data such as start date/time, end date/time, time zone, sensor value, type; temporary basal rate, date; app settings such as display options, activated integrations; or coaching (status, targets, other illnesses). 2.1.3 If you wish, you can operate the user account under an assumed name (pseudonym), i.e. you do not have to state your real name. You can also enter any email address that you set up especially for us – however it must work so that we can send you important warnings. The scope of the data recorded by mySugr depends on your registration and use of our products. We only process the User Data that you actively and voluntarily provide to mySugr. The entry of requested User Data is however a requirement for the comprehensive use of our products. If you do not enter optional data the associated functionality of our products is limited accordingly. For example our Logbook or Bolus Calculator require detailed (voluntary) entry of your data in order to ensure optimal use. 2.1.4 In addition to the entries you provide voluntarily, there is also the option of independently activating or deactivating the recording of certain data in the settings of our apps and other software of your device (e.g. operating system, other apps, app stores etc.). If you have questions, please contact support@mysugr.com. 2.2.1 All the necessary purposes of our processing are associated with providing our services: Order, delivery, support, and billing of our products (including goods from our cooperation partners) require the entry and processing of certain data in order to process your order. Installation of our apps leads to technical and device-related data recordings such as the device ID. Registration leads to the creation of your mySugr ID using the email address and password. The provision of our services requires you to voluntarily and actively enter data depending on the function and each function describes the purpose for which the data is needed. Communication from mySugr with you within our apps or via other electronic messaging services (e.g. email, messenger, telephone) where this is required to support or troubleshoot our products. This is how we process any comments and queries that you may have via various communication channels when using mySugr. The most important example is our support service, which you can access at support@mysugr.com. Please therefore think about which information and data you want to give in your active communication with us - this is solely your decision. For our part, communication with users may be necessary either by email, in-app card, or push notification. This is how we inform you about updates to our products and provide important security advice as well as assistance associated with your usage. This support communication - as an essential part of our products - is sent to users notwithstanding whether they have subscribed to our Newsletter or not. Therapy devices (e.g. blood glucose meters) can be paired with your device which enables data to be transferred to our apps. Health apps, such as those by Apple, and other connected services also enable data to be exchanged with our apps. But synchronization only takes place if you activate this in the settings of our apps, namely, if you use the function. 2.2.2 Use of our apps and extensions requires you to actively and voluntarily enter data. You will find additional selection options in the settings of our apps. To resolve an error in the app we require, for example, crash reports that we can use for troubleshooting purposes to determine the circumstances of the problem. In addition, the key data of your device and your usage behavior are recorded as our contractual fulfillment, above all, means customizing our products i.e. processing individual user information, for example, depending on your location (also relevant for the search function), diabetes type or type of therapy (both are, for instance, relevant for configuring the user interface). An automated analysis of user behavior is performed exclusively for the purpose of customizing your use when fulfilling the contract and has no legal effect for you. If you consent, we also process your User Data beyond the necessary usage described in section 2 above to improve our products and services as described in more detail below. In general, we use the same User Data to improve our products as stated in section 2. In addition, mySugr may also record the following User Data: Usage Data Activity events that allow us to understand how you use our products. This enables us to see how our products are used and for example where menu designs can be optimized. 3.2 Purpose of product improvement As a result of fast-moving technological progress, we have to continually analyze, develop, test, and improve our products and their interactions, in order to ensure that our content benefits users in the most effective way. To achieve this, we conduct usage and security tests and the knowledge gained is incorporated into improved new versions of our products such as the app. These improvements are also provided to you via regular updates. 4.1.1 We would like to send you interesting information on products and services in addition to the contractual scope (including information from carefully selected partners) and invitations to participate in surveys or other sales promotions and marketing activities (“Newsletter”). 4.1.2 You can select whether you want to subscribe to our Newsletter (opt in). You can revoke your consent at any time via the link in the Newsletter or the account settings. 4.2.1 Other consents, e.g. for surveys, notifications, or customized offers, are obtained as required when you are logged in. We always explain to you why we need certain data and also how you can revoke the consent. 4.2.2 Please be aware that we may show you offers within the app without processing your personal data. You will also see these non-customized advertisements if you have not provided your consent. mySugr is committed to the science of all aspects of diabetes. Therefore, anonymous User Data may also be used for the purposes of research and statistics (always whilst complying with the recognized ethical scientific standards) and internal analyses. This is used mainly to determine and improve the effectiveness of techniques for controlling and treating diabetes. The legal basis for this is Article 9 (2) j) GDPR. The use of personal data may also be necessary to prevent abuse by users or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. We may be forced into disclosure due to binding laws, court or official decisions and instructions, criminal investigation, or in the public interest. In such cases, the storage and processing of your data are permitted by law without your consent. The legal basis for this is Article 9 (2) f) GDPR. Finally, as the manufacturer or distributor of a medical device, we are subject to increased requirements for monitoring the functionality of our product. This vigilance system required for regulatory purposes may also involve the processing of personal data. The legal basis for this is Article 9 (2) i) GDPR. 6.1.1 mySugr uses your personal data exclusively for the purposes determined in this privacy notice and the relevant consents. We ensure that each processing is restricted to the extent necessary for its purpose. 6.1.2 Each processing always guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of your personal data. This covers protection from unauthorized and illegal processing, unintentional loss, unintentional destruction or damage using appropriate technical and organizational measures. We use strict internal processes, security features, and the latest encryption methods, always taking into account state-ofthe- art technology and implementation costs. 6.2.1 Our products are subject to complex processes that, in light of our millions of users, we have to manage and keep up-to-date. For technical support we therefore use affiliated companies of the Roche Group – F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. - and third-party suppliers (“Processors”) in order to offer you a comprehensive and optimal use of our products. 6.2.2 mySugr transfers User Data to Processors exclusively within the framework of this privacy notice and only to fulfill the purposes stated in it. Processors work according to our specifications and instructions; they are not permitted to use the personal data of our users for their own or other purposes. 6.2.3 We use Processors offering sufficient guarantees that suitable technical and organizational measures are undertaken in a way that the processing of personal data complies with the statutory requirements and our privacy notice. The protection of the rights of our users is ensured by concluding binding contracts that meet the strict requirements of GDPR. 6.2.4 The third-party suppliers appointed by mySugr may only use other processors (subcontractors) with our prior consent. If a subcontractor does not comply with the same data protection obligations and all of the appropriate security measures that we impose on our Processors, then we will prohibit the hiring of such a subcontractor. 6.3.1 Each data transfer, without exception and by default, is encrypted during transfer. Using HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) we ensure that your data is not intercepted by unauthorized third parties. In addition, for the purposes of data security and minimization, we also use other processes for the encryption and pseudonymization of User Data. Of course this depends on the type, scope, and purpose of the relevant data processing and takes into account the latest technology. For example, we only disclose User Data that a Processor requires to carry out his tasks. 6.3.2 When a contractual relationship with a Processor is terminated, such Processor must, at mySugr’s discretion, either return all our User’s Data or delete it if there are no statutory storage obligations. 6.3.3 Data that requires no personal reference for processing (e.g. for research and analysis) is subject to anonymization. This prevents a connection to a specific user being made in all cases. 6.4.1 We primarily select cooperation partners who are based in or whose servers are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). Data transmission within the EU and EEA is unobjectionable because the GDPR applies in all member states. 6.4.2 In exceptional circumstances we appoint third-party suppliers who are located in or who have servers outside the EU, e.g. innovative companies in Silicon Valley, USA. However, even in these cases your personal data is subject to a high protection level in line with the GDPR – either through an EU adequacy decision, which considers data protection in certain third-party countries to be appropriate (e.g. Switzerland, Israel, and New Zealand), or through certain standard contractual clauses approved by the EU, which the contractual relationships with our contracted data processors are based on, or through comparable legal instruments permitted under the GDPR. In any case, all Processors are subject to the obligations in this privacy notice. 6.4.3 In addition, we ensure that our partners have additional security standards in place, such as individual security measures and data protection provisions or certifications under the GDPR. So, for example, if third-party suppliers are located in the USA they should be subject to the Privacy Shield Framework approved by the EU or comparable internationally recognized security standards. 6.5.1 Our cooperation partners are bound by the agreements signed with mySugr as well as by the GDPR and only process data according to our instructions. We provide our users’ Data only to fulfill the contract: Manufacturers and suppliers require personal data to handle orders for goods. A typical example is the delivery of a blood glucose meter and test strips as part of the mySugr Bundle. Insurance companies may exchange data with us if you buy our products as part of your health insurance (statutory or private). If applicable, this enables billing based on the tariff of your insurance company. Bookkeeping and payment service providers support us in the ongoing billing of our chargeable products. Customer support services and their tools help our customer support to quickly and efficiently handle our users’ inquiries. Here, for example, queries are recorded from various communication channels and grouped according to topics using ticket systems. Analysis service providers and their tools help us to understand how users use our products in order for us to provide customized communication and product improvements in the future. This way we can avoid that e.g. a pump user with type 1 diabetes receives messages about type 2 diabetes or pens. Marketing service providers support us in creating, sorting, customizing, and sending newsletters, emails, and other messages about our products to our users. Hosting and cloud services and their tools are used to store data and to produce anonymized analyses (see section 2.4 above). Reminder: the transfer of data to our Processors and service providers is protected by guarantees such as adequacy decisions, certifications (Privacy Shield) or standard contractual clauses. A copy of such guarantees or information on these can be requested from privacy@mysugr.com. 6.5.2 Finally please note that you have the option to directly share certain data with a third party from within our products. This relates, for example, to reports generated in our apps and communication with your healthcare professional or mySugr Coach for therapy advice. You are solely responsible for such data transfers. mySugr stores so-called “cookies” to offer you a comprehensive range of functions and make the use of our website more convenient. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device by your browser. Except for the cookies for usage data mentioned in section 6.7, our cookies are used to operate the website. If you do not want to use cookies you can prevent them from being stored using the relevant settings in the browser. Most of our cookies are either deleted at the end of your visit or when the browser is closed (session cookies). If this is not the case, you can check the deletion period in your browser or delete the cookies manually. Please note that this may restrict the functionality or scope of our offer. We only use Google Universal Analytics in the publicly accessible part of our website (no login required), a web analysis service by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield; we also have a processing contract in place with Google. Google Universal Analytics uses cookies (see above) to enable analysis of your website use and these may be stored for up to 2 years if you do not delete them before that time. The information generated by the cookie on your use of our website is generally transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA. We have extended Google Analytics on our website to include the “gat.anonymizeIp();” code in order for IP addresses to be recorded anonymously. At our request, Google only records your IP address in abbreviated form thus ensuring anonymization that does not permit any conclusions to be made about your identity or device. Google abbreviates IP addresses within the EU or other members states which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional circumstances is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and reduced there. At our request Google will use this information to analyze your use of the website in order to provide us with aggregated reports and provide other services associated with Internet usage. The IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You can prevent the storage of cookies using the appropriate setting in your browser, as described in section 6.6 above. In addition, you can prevent the processing of the data generated by the cookie relating to your use of the website (incl. the IP address) by Google by installing the browser plugin available under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. 6.8.1 Your User Data is stored on your device. This data is also stored on our servers. We only use systems that meet GDPR requirements. 6.8.2 During registration you can select whether your data should be stored on servers in the European Union (EU) or the USA. By default, storage is set to the region of your current location during registration. Regardless of the storage location we ensure that the high protection level pursuant to the GDPR is guaranteed; naturally this also applies to data that is stored temporarily at another location or is transferred for processing. 6.8.3 As a rule, mySugr only stores your personal data for the duration of the contract. In exceptional cases, longer storage may be required in order to fulfill post-contractual obligations or to comply with statutory storage obligations or disclosure duties, or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (limitation periods). Minors, below the age of sixteen are only permitted to use our products with the consent of a parent/guardian (see section 3.2.3 of our General Terms and Conditions - T&Cs). This also applies to processing their personal data, which is only legal if and to the extent to which the consent has been obtained by and through the parent/guardian. Otherwise use of our products is prohibited. 6.10.1 Our data protection officer is available to answer all data protection questions at privacy@mysugr.com. The data protection officer monitors ‒ independently and not bound by instructions ‒ compliance with all data protection regulations and is subject to strict statutory secrecy and confidentiality obligations. 6.10.2 The data protection officer is widely involved in all questions associated with protecting the personal data of our users. As a trained expert, he monitors our processing on an ongoing basis, informs and regularly advises the entire mySugr team in order to ensure the best possible protection of your User Data. 6.11.1 As technology and processes in the Internet as well as data protection legislation are constantly being developed, we have to undertake changes from time to time. We will inform you of changes by appropriate means whilst granting an appropriate advance notice period and if necessary obtaining new consents. 6.11.2 Unless otherwise provided by this privacy notice, the same definitions apply in our General Terms and Conditions - T&Cs. If we process your User Data based on your consent, you may revoke the consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the revocation. We will continue to provide our services if they do not depend on the consent that has been revoked. 7.2. Information, correction, and restriction 7.2.1 Each user has the right to request information on the processing of their personal data. To do so, please contact us at any time at privacy@mysugr.com. 7.2.2 Your right to information covers information on the processing purposes, data and recipient categories, storage time, origin of your data, and your rights under the data protection regulations. You can find all of this information in this privacy notice and we are happy to provide it to you in an electronic form. 7.2.3 Should some of your personal data be incorrect, you can request that your data is corrected or completed at any time. You can correct most data yourself in our apps. You have the right to restrict data processing for the duration of any investigation review that you have requested. Each user has the right to request the deletion of their personal data. To do so, please contact us at any time at support@mysugr.com. Finally each user has the right to request that we provide an overview of their personal data to another responsible party, if this is technically feasible. 7.5.1 If you feel we are not protecting your data protection rights adequately, please contact us at any time at support@mysugr.com or contact our data protection officer directly at privacy@mysugr.com. We will handle your request immediately. 7.5.2 Any user has the right to submit a complaint with the Austrian Data Protection Authority responsible for mySugr at Wickenburggasse 8-10, 1080 Vienna if they believe that the processing of their personal data is not in compliance with data protection regulations. In addition, the user has a right to complain to a supervisory authority in the EU member state in which they are resident, in which their workplace is located, or which is the location of a suspected infringement.

This US Addendum supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this US Addendum has the meaning given in our Privacy Policy. This US Addendum does not apply to information we collect about individuals in their capacity as present or former job applicants, employees, contractors, owners, directors, or officers of Natural Cycles. As used in this US Addendum, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a particular consumer or household. “Sensitive Personal Information” refers to certain types of Personal Information that are subject to heightened protections by law, such as health data.

Further, please note that we do not knowingly Sell or Share the Personal Information of anyone under 16 years old. Requests may be submitted by yourself or an authorized agent by emailing us at support@naturalcycles.com or using the request web form. We will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law, taking into account the type and sensitivity of the Personal Information subject to the request. We may need to request additional Personal Information from you, such as [email address, state of residency, or mailing address], to verify your identity and protect against fraudulent requests. If you maintain a password-protected account with us, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account and require you to re-authenticate yourself before disclosing or deleting your Personal Information.

"privacy_policies/Nutritionix.txt","Nutritionix","Introducing Syndigo OpenAI Connect and Syndigo GEO for Agentic Commerce Readiness. Syndigo Privacy Notice Last updated: March 20, 2025 Syndigo LLC and any affiliate entity controlled directly or indirectly by it (collectively, “Syndigo”, “we”, “us”, “our”) take the protection of your personal data (“Personal Data”) very seriously. Please read this Privacy Notice (the “Notice”) to learn what we’re doing with your Personal Data, how we protect it, and your privacy rights. This Notice is designed to assist you to understand how and why we process your Personal Data when: Within the scope of this Notice, Syndigo is the business that makes the decisions about the processing of your Personal Data (also known as the “data controller” or “business”), unless expressly specified otherwise. This Notice does not cover: This Notice tells you, among other things: The table below describes the categories of Personal Data we have collected about you in the last twelve months. We will not collect additional categories of Personal Data without informing you. We use cookies and other online tracking technologies on our Website and in our applications. To learn about Syndigo’s use of cookies on the Website, please read our Cookie Notice. To learn about Syndigo’s use of cookies in CES, read the CES Cookie Notice. We process your Personal Data for the following purposes: To achieve the above purposes, we need to perform different types of processing activities on your Personal Data, such as storage, access, transmission, consultation, manipulation, and combination. When the purposes of processing are satisfied, we will delete the related Personal Data within thirty (30) days, or upon receipt of a verified request. You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making. There will always be human intervention into decisions based on automated processing, including automated analytics, testing, and profiling. If this position changes, or there is a need and lawful basis to do so, we will inform you. We share your Personal Data with certain service providers who assist us in operating our Website, conducting our business, or servicing you. The categories of service providers to which we may disclose your Personal Data include: We enter into agreements with our service providers (also known as “processors”) to ensure that they keep your Personal Data confidential, only use it for the services they provide to Syndigo and treat your Personal Data with the same level of protection that we do. Syndigo does not sell your Personal Data in the conventional sense (for money). Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you or analyze our Website traffic and we share your Personal Data with these business partners for this purpose and their use. Making Personal Data (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies is considered a “sale” under applicable data protection and privacy laws. If you would like to opt out of the sale of your Personal Data that take place via cookies and other online tracking technologies, you can learn how below in the Privacy Rights section of this Notice. We may disclose your Personal Data to the extent required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that we need to disclose it to comply with official investigations or legal proceedings (whether initiated by governmental/law enforcement officials, or private parties). If we have to disclose your Personal Data to governmental/law enforcement officials, we may not be able to ensure that those officials will maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Data. We may also disclose your Personal Data if we sell or transfer all or some of our company’s business interests, assets, or both, or in connection with a corporate restructuring. Finally, we may disclose your Personal Data to our subsidiaries or affiliates, but only if necessary for business purposes, as described in the section above. We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data for any legal purpose. Such data does not include any Personal Data. The purposes may include analyzing usage trends or seeking compatible advertisers, sponsors, and customers. Syndigo is headquartered in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and its data centers are primarily in the U.S. Syndigo also uses many U.S.-based services providers. This means that your Personal Data is primarily stored by us and our service providers in the U.S. However, we operate globally through our affiliates, subsidiaries, and services providers. This means that we may store and transfer your Personal Data to our affiliates, subsidiaries, and service providers who are in different countries if it is relevant for the delivery of our Services and products, or applicable for business operations. Note if you are located in the EU: Some of our service providers and affiliates are located outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area. In some cases, the European Commission may have determined the data protection laws of some countries provide a level of protection equivalent to European Union law. You can see here the list of countries that the European Commission has recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to Personal Data. We will only transfer your Personal Data to third parties in countries not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to Personal Data when there are appropriate safeguards in place. These safeguards include the European-Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses under Article 46.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the Data Privacy Framework (as defined below), or other approved mechanisms. For individuals whose Personal Data is safeguarded by the Data Privacy Framework: Before sending your Personal Data to a third party, we will do one of two things: We are accountable and liable for the protection of your Personal Data when we transfer it to others except when we can prove that we are not responsible for an event that leads to any unauthorized or improper processing. Note if you are located in Brazil: Some of these third parties may be located outside of Brazil. In some cases, the Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (“ANPD”) may have determined that certain countries’ data protection laws provide an equivalent level of protection to the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (“LGPD”). Where this is not the case, we will only transfer your Personal Data to third parties located in other countries when there are appropriate safeguards in place which the ANPD has confirmed as acceptable. With respect to Personal Data processed in the scope of this Notice, Syndigo LLC complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (and its UK Extension) and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the “Data Privacy Framework”) as adopted and put forward by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of Personal Data. Syndigo LLC commits to upholding the Data Privacy Framework Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Notice and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/. Syndigo LLC is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. Where a privacy complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we have agreed to participate in the VeraSafe Data Privacy Framework Dispute Resolution Procedure. Subject to the terms of the VeraSafe Data Privacy Framework Dispute Resolution Procedure, VeraSafe will provide appropriate recourse free of charge to you. To file a complaint with VeraSafe and participate in the VeraSafe Data Privacy Framework Dispute Resolution Procedure, please submit the required information through the web form located here: https://www.verasafe.com/privacy-services/dispute-resolution/submit-dispute/. If a complaint or dispute related to Personal Data cannot be resolved through Syndigo’s internal process, in addition to the VeraSafe Dispute Resolution Procedure, Syndigo has agreed to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities (“DPAs”), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“FDPIC”), and to take part in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by such data protection authorities. If your dispute or complaint cannot be resolved by us, nor through the dispute resolution program established by VeraSafe or the dispute resolution procedures established by the DPAs, the ICO or the FDPIC, you may have the right to require that we enter into binding arbitration with you pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework’s “Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle” and Annex I of the Data Privacy Framework. Whenever Personal Data is collected and processed, there is always a slight risk that the Personal Data may be breached, misused, or otherwise result in a harm to you. However, we take several measures to ensure that this risk is mitigated as much as possible. These measures include limiting the Personal Data about you that we collect and process to solely what is necessary, not collecting sensitive Personal Data about you, and implementing appropriate security measures, as described in this Notice. The GDPR and other applicable data protection laws require that we have a valid reason to use your Personal Data. This is called the “lawful basis for processing.” When operating as a data controller, we may process your Personal Data: When we rely on legitimate interests as a lawful basis of processing, you have the right to ask us more about how we decided to choose this legal basis. To do so, please use the contact details provided at the end of this Notice. Where we process your Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect the validity of our processing of Personal Data performed on other lawful grounds. Where we receive your Personal Data as part of providing our Services to you based on a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract. Without that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide the Services to you. You have specific rights regarding your Personal Data collected and processed by us. Please note that you can only exercise these rights with respect to Personal Data that we process about you when we act as a data controller or as a “business”. To exercise your rights with respect to information processed by us on behalf of one of our customers, please read the privacy notice of that customer. Syndigo acknowledges the right of EU, UK and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework and will grant individuals reasonable access to Personal Data we received pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete such information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or processed in violation of the Data Privacy Framework Principles. Additionally, if we have received your Personal Data in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework, you may also have the right to opt out of having your Personal Data shared with third parties and to revoke your consent to our sharing your Personal Data with third parties. You may also have the right to opt out if your Personal Data is used for any purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or which you originally authorized. An individual may request to access their Personal Data, or otherwise correct, amend, delete, withdraw their consent or limit the processing of their Personal Data in line with the Data Privacy Framework Principles by contacting us. In this section, we first describe those rights and then we explain how you can exercise those rights. This is called the right to be informed. It means that you have the right to obtain from us all information regarding our data processing activities that concern you, such as how we collect and use your Personal Data, how long we will keep it, and who it will be shared with, among other things. We are informing you of how we process your Personal Data with this Notice. This is called the right of access. This right allows you to ask for full details of the Personal Data we hold about you. You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we process Personal Data concerning you, and, where that is the case, a copy or access to the Personal Data and certain related information. Once we receive and confirm that the request comes from you or your authorized agent, we will disclose to you: Please take into account that certain data protection laws allows us not to satisfy your access request when: Certain data protection laws do not allow us to disclose account passwords or security questions and answers. We can inform you that we have this information generally, but we may not provide the specific items to you for security and legal reasons. This is called the right to rectification. It gives you the right to ask us to correct anything that you think is wrong with the Personal Data we have on file about you and to complete any incomplete Personal Data. This is called the right to erasure, right to deletion or the “right to be forgotten”. This right means you can ask for your Personal Data to be deleted. You may be able to remove information from your account after logging in or even to entirely delete your account on our Services. If there is any other Personal Data you would like deleted, you can ask us to do so using the contact information listed in this Notice. Sometimes we can delete your information, but other times it may not be possible, such as when the law tells us we cannot do so. If that is the case, we will consider if we can limit how we use it. There may also be circumstances where we deny your request to delete your information under applicable law, such as if we or our service providers need to retain the Personal Data to: This is called the right to restrict processing. It is the right to ask us to only use or store your Personal Data for certain purposes. You have this right in certain occasions, such as where you believe the data is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful. This right enables you to ask us to suspend the usage of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it. This is called the right to object. This is your right to tell us to stop using your Personal Data. You have this right where we rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party). Also, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. We will stop processing the relevant Personal Data unless: (i) we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms; or (ii) we need to continue processing your Personal Data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim This is called the right to data portability. It is the right to ask for and download Personal Data about you that you have given us or that you have generated by virtue of the use of our services, so that you can: We will provide your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. When you make a data portability request electronically, we will provide you a copy in electronic format. Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your Personal Data, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, our use of your Personal Data before you withdraw is still lawful. If you have given consent for your details to be shared with a third party, and wish to withdraw this consent, please also contact the relevant third party in order to change your preferences. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights, meaning we will not: If the GDPR applies to the processing of your Personal Data with us, the GDPR grants you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data. In particular, you can lodge a complaint in the Member State of the European Union of your habitual residence, place of work, or of the alleged violation of the GDPR. If the LGPD applies to the processing of your Personal Data with us, the LGPD grants you the right to lodge a complaint with the ANPD if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data. Depending on the region where you are located, you have the “right to opt out” of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Data, which means you have the right to ask us to not sell or share your Personal Data at any time for specified purposes. A “sale” includes disclosing or making available Personal Data to a third party (other than a service provider) in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. Under certain data protection laws, “sharing” includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising. Our use of some online tracking technologies for statistical and marketing purposes is the only sale or share of your Personal Data by Syndigo. To opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Data, you can change your consent preferences through our cookie consent management platform. In particular, you need to choose not to allow the following categories of cookies: Statistics and marketing. Please consider that the preferences you submit through the cookie consent management platform, including your requests to opt out from the sale of personal information, may be stored in cookies or similar technologies that are specific to your browser. If this browser is configured to block cookies or similar technologies, our tool may not be able to store your preferences. In addition, deleting cookies on this browser may result in your preferences being removed. If your preferences are removed after you delete cookies from this browser, you will have to update these preferences again. Also, remember that private browsing technologies (such as incognito mode) automatically delete all local storage and cookies when the browsing session ends, preventing us from recording your choice made during the session, and from accessing any local storage created outside of the current session, which does not enable us to access the choice you made during a normal or previous private browsing session. We’ll only store your preferences in this browser. Because some companies may not connect information about this browser with other web browsers or devices you may use (such as a web browser on another computer you may use, or one on a mobile device), you need update your preferences through the cookie consent management platform to set your preferences separately for other browsers or devices you may use. You can also alter the configuration of your browser to reject certain types of online tracking technologies. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature, but there’s no agreed-upon standard for how websites should respond. Therefore, we currently do not support DNT requests. For more information about how to manage and delete cookies in your browser, please visit https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-and-delete-cookies. As our use of some of the cookies for statistical and marketing purposes is the only sale of your Personal Data that Syndigo may be engaging in, the only way to opt in to sales of Personal Data is to change your cookie preferences through our cookie consent management platform. In particular, you need to choose to allow the following categories of cookies: Statistics and Marketing. To exercise any of the rights described above, please submit a request by either: Bear in mind that to evaluate your privacy rights requests, we need to be sure it was you who made the request. Consequently, we may need some information to confirm that you are who you say you are. For requests submitted via password-protected accounts, your identity is already verified. For requests sent by other means, you will need to provide us with sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data. Generally, we will request only information that we may have about you to confirm your identity, but under some circumstances we may require additional information or documentation to complete your request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use the Personal Data you provide us in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. Please note that you may only make a consumer request to know or data portability twice within a 12-month period under the CCPA. If you are submitting a request on behalf of somebody else, we will need to verify your authority to act on behalf of that individual. When contacting us, please provide us with proof that the individual gave you signed permission to submit this request. Alternatively, you may ask the individual to directly contact us by using the contact details above to verify their identity with us and confirm that they gave you permission to submit this request. We will only use the Personal Data you provide us in a request to verify your authority. We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) days and, in that communication, we will also describe our identity verification process (if needed) and when you should expect a response, unless we have already granted or denied the request. Please allow us up to thirty (30) days to reply to you from the day we received your request. If we need more time (up to 90 days in total), we will inform you of the reason why, and the extension period, in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will send our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. If we cannot satisfy a request from you, we will also explain why in our response. We will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests unless we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. Syndigo provides business to business products and Services.

"privacy_policies/Ovia.Health.txt","Ovia.Health","This Ovia Health by Labcorp Apps Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Ovuline, Inc., doing business as Ovia Health by Labcorp (“Ovia”) collects, uses and shares personal data collected through the Ovia apps, health coaching, surveys, and related social media and marketing activities (the “Services”). Ovia Health by Labcorp is a subsidiary of Labcorp, a global life-sciences leader. Some parts of this Policy only apply to Ovia’s free consumer version of the Services, while others only apply to the enhanced paid versions provided as a benefit by employers, health plans and health care providers. In this Policy, we refer to these different versions as the “Consumer” and “Ovia+” versions of the Services. To view the full version of this Policy, click “Full Privacy Policy” above; the “Notice of Collection” is a shorter version required for California law. This Policy does not apply to personal data collected outside the scope of the Services. For Ovia’s non-app Privacy Policy, which covers personal data collected by Ovia from business contacts or through our corporate website, please see our Non-App Privacy Policy. “Personal data” means information about you that identifies you, like a name, telephone number or other bit of information that is used to tell us who you are. Personal data includes “direct identifiers” such as your email address and also “indirect identifiers” that could be used to identify you such as the IP address and the Advertising ID of your mobile device. We collect the following categories of personal data in connection with our Services: We use your personal data to: Lawful Processing. Our processing of your personal data is based on one or more of the following: The table below describes the purposes for our use and collection by category. If you receive the premium “Ovia+” version of Ovia through your health insurer, employer or employer health plan, your Ovia+ services include data sharing with your insurer, employer health plan, employer, or vendors working on their behalf in accordance with HIPAA and other privacy laws. Data sharing does not occur for all Ovia+ clients. If you would like definitive information on the data sharing for your account, please contact support@oviahealth.com. Our Ovia+ data sharing policy is as follows: As of June 2025, Ovia no longer shows advertising to our Consumer users and does not sell or share any personal data for advertising. Please see the table at the end of this document for the categories of personal data sold or shared for advertising before we terminated our advertising business. To its knowledge, Ovia does not sell or share any personal data of Ovia users under 16. Ovia no longer shows advertising. Prior to the termination of our advertising business in June 2025, we shared identifiers, internet and app activity information and inferred purchase interests with our ad sales platform, advertising networks, advertising platforms or advertising technology providers to sell, administer, serve and purchase ads.

Ovia discloses personal data to processors who act on Ovia’s behalf (our principal processors are listed on our Subprocessors Page). Our analytics vendor Appsflyer provides its services to Ovia as a processor, but may act as a controller when using personal data for its internal security, error correction and compliance purposes. Ovia protects personal data with security measures that are consistent with industry standards, including background checks on all employees and data encryption in transit and at rest. Ovia’s Ovia+ product has achieved certification to the HITRUST Common Security Framework. Our principal database is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which maintains multiple security certifications. We will notify you of security incidents as required by law, and you agree that, when permitted by law, such notices may be sent by email to the email address associated with your Ovia account. If you are a Consumer user, we store your data (all categories) for the period that your account is active and then for 7 years after that. After this period, we automatically delete your data. If you are an Ovia+ user, we store your data (all categories) during the period that you are receiving Ovia+ benefits. Ovia is generally required to delete your data after your Ovia+ benefits end. We will notify you before your data is deleted and, where possible, offer you the opportunity to convert your account to a Consumer account and retain your data. While these are our standard retention periods, you can delete your data at any time as described in the next section. Within the Ovia Apps You can use self-service controls within the Ovia apps to exercise your data subject rights to: Opting Out Through Browser-Based Global Privacy Controls Ovia does not receive a “do not sell” Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal when you are using Ovia’s mobile applications or viewing content through in-app webviews.

Deidentified Data and Aggregated Data: Ovia may use personal data to create deidentified data for research and development purposes. Deidentified data is not personal data as it is no longer linked or linkable to you. If we create a deidentified dataset we maintain it as such and will not re-identify it. We may provide deidentified data to our research partners, such as universities and medical research institutions for research, and to other businesses who have engaged us to provide research services on deidentified or aggregated data. Ovia may disclose or sell deidentified data derived from patient information (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act); if so, such patient information is deidentified in accordance with HIPAA safe harbor or expert determination deidentification requirements.

Ovia may receive compensation for sharing deidentified or aggregate data. Social Media: Some Ovia content may appear on Ovia’s social media channels. Ovia does not collect personal data through those channels, and the respective privacy policies of the social media provider will apply to your usage of those channels.

Ovia may modify this Policy from time to time by posting an updated version of the Policy. When we make material changes this Policy, we will notify users by email or in-app notification.

You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your device. 7.3 ""Do Not Track"" / Global Privacy Control Do Not Track (""DNT"") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that, because there has been no agreed industry standard, we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar “do not track” mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. Please note you may opt out, and we honor, certain technologies broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). This occurs on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal. This request will be linked to your browser identifier only. If an opt-out a signal is sent by a web browser on your behalf that will communicate your choice to opt-out of sharing for targeted advertisements. If you have enabled GPC on your browser, you will automatically be opted out of any “sharing” when you interact with our site. You can learn more about how to use opt-out preference signals by visiting the Global Privacy Control website 7.4 Your rights to access and manage personal information We recognize the importance of your personal information and provide simple ways for you to exercise the following rights: access (right to know), portability, rectification (correction or update), deletion (erasure), object to and restrict (withdraw) processing. Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights under other applicable laws, subject to conditions and restrictions provided in those laws. You can exercise these rights via the following ways: Contact us if you have any questions, see the HOW TO CONTACT US section below.

DATA RETENTION Peloton retains the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws. Legal requirements, however, may require us to retain some or all of the personal information we hold for a period of time that is longer than that for which we might otherwise hold it. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. CCTV images are retained for 14 days in Germany and 30 days elsewhere. When we are no longer required to retain the personal information as described above, we will destroy, erase, or de-identify it. 9. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards (which vary depending on the sensitivity of the personal information) designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access of personal information. 10. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned, applicable laws and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (such as to provide our Services), (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate business interest and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate business interest (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Services, to communicate with you as necessary to provide our Services to you, and for our legitimate commercial interests such as responding to your queries, improving our products and Services, undertaking marketing, or detecting and preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, you can contact us using the details provided under the HOW TO CONTACT US section below. 11.

Our postal address is: Griva Digeni, 115, Trident Centre, 3101, Limassol, Cyprus We are Neybox Digital Ltd., a company registered in the Republic of Cyprus. We develop and operate Pillow: Automatic Sleep Tracker (""Pillow""), an app that helps you understand and improve your sleep quality. You can use Pillow anonymously without providing name or email, as no registration is required. Your health data stays on your device. Your sleep tracking, audio recording data, personal preferences and configuration data also stays on your device except if you enable iCloud for data synchronisation between devices or backups. In this case, a copy of that data will be stored on your iCloud storage space. This space is only accessible by you. As developers we do not have access to this storage space. For marketing analytics, we use randomly generated identifiers created fresh with each app installation - not persistent device IDs or IDFA. These random IDs cannot be linked across app reinstalls or devices, and we often cannot access them directly. Third-party services like Adjust may share these temporary, installation-specific IDs with advertising partners (Meta, Google) solely to measure campaign effectiveness. Since these are non-persistent, randomly generated IDs that reset on each install, they provide minimal tracking capability and maximum privacy protection by design. We do not sell your data. Core App Functionality - Sleep Tracking and Analysis (All On-Device)Pillow analyzes your sleep using motion sensors, Apple Watch data, and optional audio recording but all processing happens entirely on your device. We never see, access any or the raw of generated data (sleep sessions, audio recordings, other sleep health related metrics) This data exists only on your device and in your personal iCloud backup (if enabled). We have no access to it, and neither do our analytics providers. You control this data completely and can delete it anytime by removing the app or by deleting your iCloud data. Technical Support with Health Data (Only When You Explicitly Share)If you experience issues with Pillow, you can choose to share your sleep data, audio recordings, or Apple Health data with our support team to help diagnose and resolve problems. This sharing is completely voluntary and only happens when you explicitly select the option to include this data in your support request. We use this data solely to investigate your specific issue and improve Pillow's functionality. Service ImprovementThird-party services collect anonymous usage data, device identifiers, and optional profile information (age, sex, sleep disorder if you provide them) to help us fix bugs, improve features, and understand how Pillow is used. This never includes your actual sleep data, health metrics, or audio recordings. Marketing AnalyticsWe use Adjust to share pseudonymous device IDs with Meta and Google. This helps us understand which advertising campaigns bring users to Pillow. We never share health data, sleep data, audio recordings, or profile information for marketing purposes. NewsletterIf you subscribe to our newsletter, we use your email to send sleep tips and product updates. Third-Party Processors and TransfersWe work with these service providers who process data on our behalf: Apple iCloud provides optional backup services and may store encrypted sleep data if enabled, with servers located in USA and EU. When you submit feedback or report issues through the app, anonymous diagnostic information is stored in Apple's CloudKit infrastructure. This data contains no personal identifiers and cannot be linked to you. We use Mixpanel to understand how Pillow is used and improve the app experience. Mixpanel receives a randomly generated ID that resets when you reinstall the app, along with information about which app features you use, your subscription status, and basic device information like model and iOS version. If you choose to provide it, Mixpanel may also receive optional profile information such as age, gender, or whether you have a sleep disorder, but this is always linked only to your random ID, never to your name or email. Mixpanel never receives any of your sleep data, health data, or audio recordings. They process this information under appropriate data protection safeguards. We use RevenueCat to process in-app purchases and manage subscriptions. RevenueCat receives purchase receipts and a randomly generated ID that is created on your device. This ID may sync across your devices through your iCloud Keychain to facilitate purchase restoration, but it cannot be used to identify you personally. RevenueCat does not receive your name, email address, or any health data. They process this information in the United States under appropriate data protection safeguards. We use Sentry to monitor app crashes, fix errors, and improve Pillow's reliability. When an error or performance issue occurs, Sentry receives diagnostic information including error messages, crash logs, device model, iOS version, app version, and a randomly generated ID that resets when you reinstall the app. Sentry never receives your name, email, or any health data. They process this information in the United States under appropriate data protection safeguards. We use Statsig to test new features and analyze how Pillow is used to improve functionality and user experience. When you interact with the app, Statsig receives usage data including app events, feature engagement metrics, and a randomly generated ID that resets when you reinstall the app. Statsig never receives your name, email, or any health data. They process this information in the United States under appropriate data protection safeguards. We use Adjust to help understand app usage and attribute engagement, while maintaining user anonymity. The only data transmitted are randomly created IDs (randomly generated per installation and resets on every install) and event metadata. Without the advertising identifier (IDFA), this data cannot be used to track or identify users. The random identifiers reset on every reinstall and cannot be linked to you or used for targeted advertising. Pillow’s Adjust integration uses global data residency by default, meaning data may be processed and stored across Adjust’s worldwide infrastructure rather than within a specific region. This setup may result in your anonymized usage data crossing national or regional borders, subject to the data protection and privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions. Adjust aggregates raw data so that it cannot be traced back to individual users after processing. We configure Adjust to align with applicable privacy laws, such as GDPR, by limiting retention and collecting only necessary event data. We configure Adjust to comply with applicable privacy laws by setting appropriate data retention and consent parameters. We use Meta’s advertising networks (Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network) to show ads and measure their effectiveness. Pillow does not include Meta’s SDK or send data directly to Meta from the app. Instead, any ad attribution or performance measurement occurs through our analytics provider Adjust, which communicates with Meta. Meta Receives data from Adjust and Apple (not from Pillow’s app) such as install/open signals and limited campaign performance data necessary for attribution/measurement according to the Meta–Adjust integration. Where applicable, attribution may also rely on platform-provided frameworks such as Apple’s SKAdNetwork and/or aggregated measurement features offered by Meta. Pillow does not transmit your name, email, or other directly identifying personal, sleep, audio or health data to Meta from the app. Attribution data is relayed indirectly via Adjust, and consists only of the limited signals needed for ad measurement as described above. Meta may process this information in their global infrastructure, which may include countries outside your region. When data is transferred internationally, appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses are in place. We use Google Ads to run and measure advertising campaigns for Pillow. Pillow does not include Google’s advertising SDK and does not send data directly from the app to Google. Instead, any ad attribution or performance measurement occurs through our analytics provider Adjust, which integrates with Google Ads. Google Receives data from Adjust (not from the Pillow app) and Apple such as install/open signals and limited campaign performance data needed for attribution/optimization under the Adjust/Google Ads integration (for example, session and post-install events; on iOS, SKAdNetwork postbacks may also be used). Pillow does not transmit names, emails, or other directly identifying personal, sleep, audio or health data to Google from the app. Attribution data is relayed indirectly via Adjust and is limited to what is necessary for ad measurement as described above. Google may process this information in their global infrastructure, which may include countries outside your region. When data is transferred internationally, appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses are in place. We use Intercom to provide customer messaging and support outside the Pillow app, such as through our website and help channels. When you contact us through Intercom, the information you choose to share, such as your name, email address, and the content of your messages, along with standard technical details like your device type and browser, is sent to Intercom. All Pillow-related Intercom data is hosted in the United States using Amazon Web Services. Intercom acts as our data processor under a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, and processes information solely according to our instructions. We also use Intercom’s Fin AI feature to help provide automated responses to some support requests. This means that conversation content may be processed by automated systems to generate replies and assist our support team. Intercom applies industry-standard security measures, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls, and the use of Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers when required by law. Visitor conversation data is retained for as long as necessary to provide support and may be deleted upon request in accordance with applicable privacy laws. You can contact us at any time to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data processed through Intercom. We use MailerLite to send newsletters and product updates if you choose to subscribe. When you sign up, MailerLite receives your email address, subscription preferences, and basic engagement data such as whether you opened an email. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in any newsletter. MailerLite stores this information primarily in the European Union under appropriate data protection safeguards.

We also use Intercom’s Fin AI feature to help provide automated responses to some support requests. This means that conversation content may be processed by automated systems to generate replies and assist our support team. Intercom applies industry-standard security measures, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls, and the use of Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers when required by law. Visitor conversation data is retained for as long as necessary to provide support and may be deleted upon request in accordance with applicable privacy laws. You can contact us at any time to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data processed through Intercom. We use MailerLite to send newsletters and product updates if you choose to subscribe. When you sign up, MailerLite receives your email address, subscription preferences, and basic engagement data such as whether you opened an email. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in any newsletter. MailerLite stores this information primarily in the European Union under appropriate data protection safeguards. Pillow is intended for users aged 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect or process information from individuals under 18 years of age. Because age is optional and when provided must be 18 or above, Pillow does not implement children's privacy protections or parental consent mechanisms. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the applicable age without parental consent, we will delete any information within our control as quickly as possible. Since Pillow does not require registration or user accounts, most data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account, which we cannot access or delete. Parents or guardians who believe their child under the required age is using Pillow should delete the app from the child's device and cancel any premium subscriptions through their Apple App Store account settings. If a parent or guardian believes someone under 18 is using Pillow, please contact us at pillow@neybox.com and remove the app from the device. Control Your On-Device DataSince your sleep and health data never leaves your device, you have complete control through iOS: Disable audio recording by choosing a tracking mode without audio. Manage Apple Health access in iOS Settings or the Health app. Control iCloud sync in Pillow's settings. Delete all data using ""Delete All Data"" in Pillow settings. Export your data using Pillow's export feature. Your Privacy Rights For the limited analytics data our processors collect (tied to random IDs that reset on reinstall), you have the right to request information about what data exists, though we cannot identify your specific records without your random ID. You can request deletion of any data associated with your email if you contacted support or subscribed to our newsletter. For EU residents, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. California residents have the right to know what personal information we collect and can request deletion. To exercise these rights, contact us at pillow@neybox.com. Since most data is either on your device or tied to anonymous IDs, the most effective privacy control is simply deleting and reinstalling the app, which resets all tracking identifiers. Third-Party Service Selection: We only work with established service providers that implement industry-standard security measures including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Data Minimization: We share only the minimum data necessary with each service. Health data is never shared with analytics or marketing services. Secure Transmission: All data sent from your device to our third-party services is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols. Support Data Handling: When you explicitly share health data for support purposes, it is accessed only by authorized support staff, used only for resolving your issue. Pseudonymization: All analytics services receive only random identifiers that change when you reinstall the app, preventing long-term tracking. We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Significant changes will be notified through the app. We will never change our handling of health data without your explicit consent. As we use specialized services, retention varies by provider. Intercom: When you use in-app support without providing an email, your conversations are handled through Intercom's visitor system. While Intercom deletes visitor records after 9 months of inactivity, the conversations themselves persist in their system. Because these conversations are anonymous and the visitor record is deleted, we cannot identify or delete specific conversations upon request. Support requests through our website where you provide an email are retained in Intercom's system. These can be deleted upon request as they remain identifiable. Mailerlite: For newsletter subscriptions, we use MailerLite (UAB “MailerLite”, Lithuania) as our email marketing service provider. Your email address and any related subscription preferences are stored on MailerLite’s servers and are retained until you unsubscribe or request deletion, after which they are removed from our active mailing lists. MailerLite deletes subscriber data from their systems within 30 days of a deletion request, subject to any legal obligations to retain the data. While we cannot always control retention directly, we commit to process deletion requests with all providers within 30 days, regularly review and minimize retention where possible and be transparent about limitations. Since Pillow operates without accounts or persistent identifiers, we cannot verify user identity or link data to specific individuals. This protects your privacy but means we cannot provide access to or delete anonymous data. All sleep tracking, health metrics, and audio analysis occur exclusively on your device. We never receive, access, or process your health data. We don’t have servers collecting health data and we don’t transmit health data to any third party. We cannot sell, share, or disclose health data because we never have it. This local-only processing is fundamental to Pillow's privacy-by-design architecture.

In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (""NAI""). To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising using the NAI tool, visit here.

Personal data, including health data, may also be collected from other sources, for example if you choose to connect the Sleep Cycle app with your Life Cycle app, or other (third party) apps – e.g. Google Fit or Apple Health.

This allows the app to separate your noise(s) and movement(s) from the other app user’s, which will ultimately give you better and more to the point insights about your sleep. You can deactivate the partner link feature in the privacy settings at any time.Please note that this notice does not apply to third party products or services or the practices of companies that we do not own or control, including other companies you might interact with, in or through Sleep Cycle, unless indicated otherwise.

Manage your training. For example, to set goals and use your training dashboard. Explore new places to go. For example, to discover routes or segments where you can engage in your activity. Similarly, if several users run a specific route, that information may be used to suggest the route to other users. Provide AI Features. For example, we use machine learning or artificial intelligence, including large language models, to detect anomalies on leaderboards, generate route recommendations, or provide personalized training guidance. Visualize your activities in new ways. For example, by creating personal heatmaps or using your training log. Share insights with the Strava community. For example, by sharing your public reviews and photos of specific routes or segments. We may also analyze your public photos from specific routes or segments to attach characteristics to those routes or segments (such as shaded, waterfalls, flowers). To contact you regarding the Services. We use your contact information, which includes name and email address, so we can contact you when needed regarding the Services, for example, to notify you about material changes to our terms.

Certain information (e.g., your name, and some profile information) is also available to non-users on the web. Your precise location information, such as where you run or ride, may also be shared on Strava or to non-users, in accordance with your privacy controls. Regarding our products or features using machine learning or artificial intelligence, including large language models, (""AI Features""), we use the information we collect to enhance the quality, reliability, and/or accuracy of our AI Features by creating, developing, training, testing, improving, and maintaining AI and ML models run by Strava or our service providers. We use aggregated, de-identified information for AI Features where possible for their purpose. Depending on your privacy controls and sharing permissions, we also may use personal information such as health and location information for AI Features, for example, to provide you with training analysis and recommendations. To customize your experience We use the information we collect and receive to customize your experience. For example, we may suggest segments, routes, challenges, or clubs on Strava that may interest you, users that you may want to follow, or new features that you may want to try. Learn more about how we use information to make recommendations here. To provide you with targeted commercial content We use the information we collect and receive to serve you with relevant promotions, subject to your notification and email preferences. For example, if we see you are an active user who has been on a monthly subscription plan for an extended period of time, we may serve you a promotion to switch to a discounted annual plan. Or if you are an active user who has never subscribed, we may send you an offer for a free subscription trial. In addition, we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including SDKs and other mobile analytics to inform targeted advertising and serve relevant ads. Learn more and manage your preferences by visiting our Cookie Policy. To protect you and the Services, as well as minors We use the information we collect and receive to protect users, enforce our Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, and Community Standards, and promote safety. For example, to help us find and remove content that violates our terms, such as hate speech or spam, as well as suspend or terminate accounts that share such content. We use automated tools to assist us in protecting and safeguarding you and other users and to keep the Service secure, for example to detect misuse and bad actors. Strava reserves the right to review accounts and user actions on the Services to ensure compliance with our Terms. You can learn more about how to report content that violates our terms and standards here. We also use device information and information contained in log files, including IP address, to maintain the security and integrity of our Services. To enhance safety and privacy for our younger users, we use dates of birth to help confirm that an athlete is old enough to use Strava, and to help provide an age-appropriate experience on Strava and the Services, including Messaging. To assist you with a support request We use the information we collect and receive to provide support in response to your requests and comments. Depending on your request, this may require us to access your account, for example, to troubleshoot or replicate a reported issue. To improve our Services We use the information we collect and receive, including feedback you provide, to conduct research, and to analyze, develop, troubleshoot, increase functionality, and otherwise improve the Services. To do this, Strava may use third-party analytics providers to gain insights into how our Services are used, using aggregated data, and to help us improve the Services. To communicate with you We may also use the information we collect and receive to market and promote the Services, activities and events on Strava, including using email and push notifications, in accordance with your preferences.

How Information is Shared We do not sell personal information or aggregated data for monetary value. We may share personal information in accordance with your preferences, as needed to run our business and provide the Services, and where required for legal purposes, as set forth below. Categories of third parties that we may share your information with are listed here. In addition, we may share aggregated data about our users, as described in more detail in the “Aggregated Information” section below. Service Providers We may share your information with third parties who provide services to Strava such as supporting, improving, promoting and securing the Services, processing payments, or fulfilling orders. These service providers only have access to the information necessary to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information. We may also engage service providers to collect information about your use of the Services over time on our behalf, to promote Strava or display information that may be relevant to your interests on the Services or other websites or services. Publicly Available Information When you join the Strava community as an individual of 18 years of age or older, your profile and your activities are set to be viewable by ”Everyone” by default. Your name and other profile information is viewable by other Strava users, and if your profile visibility is set to “Everyone,” this information is also viewable by the public, including in search engine results. Additional information and content you share may also be viewable, subject to your privacy controls. For example, your media content, and routes may be accessed by other Strava users and non-users or viewable on publicly accessible Strava pages or in search engine results. In addition, once you have uploaded your first activity to Strava, the first and last and last 200 meters of your future activity maps will be hidden by default the next time you open the Strava app. If you wish to change your default preference, you can do so at any time by following these instructions here. We provide a variety of privacy controls to manage the sharing of your information and encourage our users to adjust their controls to align with their desired experience. Sharing Information and Activities using your Strava privacy controls We share your information with other Strava users and the public in accordance with your privacy controls. For example, if your profile and your activities are set to be viewable by followers only, then a Strava user will not be able to see your uploaded activities, photos, or detailed profile information until after you have granted the Strava user permission to follow you. You can change the visibility of the activities you upload to Strava. Also, you can change the map visibility on GPS-based activities you upload to Strava. For example, you can tell us about important locations, such as your home or work address, by using our ""Hide a Specific Address"" feature in your privacy controls. We will hide any portion of your activity on your activity map that starts or ends near your hidden addresses. You can also choose to hide your start and end points (wherever they occur), or the entire map, using your Map Visibility controls. Using Strava Beacon, you can choose to invite your trusted contact(s) to view your live location while recording activities. Targeted Advertising We may use the information we collect and receive about you to provide you with targeted advertising if you accept non-essential cookies using our cookie banner or are receiving marketing communications. If you accept the cookie banner, you may opt-out of targeted advertising by clicking the “Do Not Share My Personal Information” link in the footer below or in our app by clicking on the “Personal Information Sharing” link in your Privacy Controls and following the instructions.You can also update your cookie preferences at any time here. You can update your email preferences at any time here. Your device may also allow you to opt out on iOS or Android. Third Party Services Connected via API or Other Integrations We enable you to share your information and content with third party apps, plugins, or websites that integrate with the Services, as well as with third parties who work with Strava to offer an integrated feature, such as a challenge sponsor, media streaming, or tracking device. You can choose to share your profile data and activity data (including private activities) with these third parties. Information collected by these third parties is subject to their terms and policies and may not provide you with the same privacy controls that are available on Strava (for example, hiding a specific address or the start and end points on activity maps). Strava is not responsible for the terms or policies of third parties. If you choose to use a Third-Party Account to login to Strava, we share only the information necessary for the third-party to enable you to login and to protect and secure your information. You can also share your activities with your contacts via text, email, or on social media applications like Meta, Instagram, and Twitter. If you link your Strava account to other social networks and share your activities, they may be viewable on such third-party platforms, and may include your location information. You should use caution when sharing information via third parties and you should carefully review the privacy practices of such third parties. Aggregated Information Strava may deidentify and aggregate the personal information you and others make available in connection with the Services (“Aggregated Information”) and post it publicly or share it with third parties. Examples include information about usage, demographics, routes, performance, and challenge participation and completion. Strava may use, license, or share this Aggregated Information with third parties for research, business or other purposes such as to improve walking, running or riding in cities via Strava Metro or to help our partners understand more about users, including the people who use their products and services. Strava also uses Aggregated Information to generate our Global Heatmap and other community-powered features such as Points of Interest and Start Points. Please visit your privacy controls if you would like to opt out of Strava using your information for these purposes. Subsidiaries and Acquirers of our Business or Assets We may share your information with our subsidiaries, who are required to handle your personal information in accordance with their own Privacy Policies. If Strava becomes involved in a business combination, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or other similar transaction, we may share or transfer your information in connection with such transaction. Legal Requirements We may preserve and share your information with third parties, including law enforcement, public or governmental agencies, or private litigants, within or outside your country of residence, if we determine that such disclosure is compelled by or reasonably necessary to comply with the law, including to respond to court orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal or regulatory process, or otherwise permitted by law. We may also retain, preserve or disclose your information if we determine that this is reasonably necessary or appropriate to: (1) prevent any person from death or serious bodily injury; (2) to address issues of national security or other issues of public importance; (3) to prevent or detect violations of our Terms of Service or fraud or abuse of Strava or its users; (4) or to protect our operations or our property or other legal rights, including by disclosure to our legal counsel and other consultants and third parties in connection with actual or potential litigation. Managing Your Privacy Settings Privacy Controls Strava offers several features and settings to help you manage your privacy and share your activities. We provide the same suite of privacy controls to all of our users worldwide. Most privacy controls are located in your privacy controls page, but some are specific to individual activities, athletes, routes, or features. Strava provides you the option to make your profile visible to Everyone or Request to Follow; and to make your activities visible to Everyone, only your Followers and you, or Only You. You can also hide certain details, such as your heart rate, from being viewed by others on individual activities. Click here to manage your privacy controls. Adjust Notification and Email Preferences Strava offers various ways to manage the notifications you receive. You can choose not to receive certain email notifications by indicating your preferences here. You may also unsubscribe from these emails by following the instructions contained at the bottom of these messages. In our app, you can access your “Push Notifications” in the settings menu. Where permitted by local regulations, we may opt you into marketing-related communications if you substantially interact with the Services or purchase a subscription. We may also send you periodic communications asking if you would like to opt into receiving marketing-related communications. If you receive marketing communications from one or more of our subsidiaries, you must opt-out individually from each subsidiary you are receiving brand-specific marketing from. Any administrative or service-related emails (for example, to confirm a purchase, to notify you of pricing changes, to deliver a training plan you requested, or provide an significant update to our policies, etc.) may not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the Services you requested. You are responsible for providing us with a valid email address and keeping it updated to ensure you get these email notifications. Updating Account Information You may correct, amend or update profile or account information at any time by adjusting that information in your account settings. You can use this to correct any inaccurate personal information in your account. If you need further assistance please contact Strava at https://support.strava.com. Deleting Information and Accounts and Downloading Your Data You can download your account or delete your data using our self-service tools. To download your data, including your activity files, follow the instructions here. To delete your account, follow the instructions provided here. After you make an account deletion request, we permanently and irreversibly delete your personal information from our systems, including backups. Once deleted, your data, including your account, activities and place on leaderboards cannot be reinstated. Following your deletion of your account, it may take up to 45 days to delete your personal information and system logs from our systems. Additionally, we may retain information where deletion requests are made to comply with the law and take other actions permitted by law. Note that we do not have control over content you have shared directly or publicly with others, such as segments you created on Strava, photos or videos on other social media platforms, or that others may have copied. In other words, content or information may remain available after you have deleted your account or deleted specific information from your own profile. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache. Strava also provides you the option to remove individual activities you have posted without deleting your account. Once removed, the activities may remain on Strava's systems until you delete your account. Children's Privacy Our services are not intended for, nor directed to, children under 13 years of age. We use technical measures to help prevent children under 13 years of age from creating an account and therefore do not knowingly collect personal information from anybody under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Services. Moreover, we provide additional privacy and safety protections for users under 18 years of age. For example, when users under 18 years of age create an account, their profile and activities are set by default to be viewable by followers only, and they are unable to access Messaging. We also may limit how we collect or process the personal information of individuals under 18 years of age. For example, you must be at least 16 years of age to upload heart rate data or receive heart rate analysis. How We Protect Information Strava implements measures to ensure that your information is treated securely and consistently with the terms in this Privacy Policy. We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of your information and designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, or access to personal information. In addition, you can take steps to protect your account and information such as creating a unique password for Strava that is not easily guessed and that you don't use anywhere else, not sharing your password with others, and promptly reporting suspicious activity or unauthorized account access.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your U.S. State Privacy Law rights. Right to opt out of personal information sales or shares We do not sell your personal information for monetary value. However, under certain privacy laws, some non-monetary sharing of personal information with third parties – for example to provide you with targeted advertising for Strava on other platforms – may be considered a “sale” or “share” of personal information. To the extent such laws may consider this a sale or share of personal information, Strava does not “sell” or “share” your personal information for analytics or to serve you with targeted advertising on other platforms unless you accept non-essential cookies using our cookie banner. We do not “sell” or “share” the personal information of users we know are under 16 years old. You have the right to direct us to not “sell” or “share” your personal information. If you opted into receiving our targeted advertising using our cookie banner, you may opt out of targeted advertising by (1) clicking the “Do Not Share My Personal Information” link in the footer below and following the instructions; (2) clicking in our app on the “Personal Information Sharing” link in your Privacy Controls and following the instructions; or (3) setting your cookie preferences to deny non-essential cookies.

Strava does not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than the Permitted Sensitive Personal Information Purposes, as defined under California law. Please note, according to U.S. State Privacy Laws, personal information does not generally include: Publicly available information from government records. De-identified or aggregated consumer information. Additional Disclosures for California Residents Financial Incentives. We do not generally provide a loyalty program or other financial incentive in return for the collection or use of personal information. On some occasions we may engage in a limited-time marketing event, promotional offer or discount on fees that includes a registration or other collection of personal information, and we will disclose the benefits and terms of that promotion at the time of collection. Privacy rights requests for non-customers. California privacy rights apply to all individuals (not just registered users), including job applicants, current and former employees, contractors and business partners. Job applicants may provide contact information and resume-related information (e.g., past education and experience) as well as complete relevant background checks. Employees receive internal privacy disclosure relevant to them. Contractors and business partners provide business contact information and payment-related information as necessary to facilitate a prospective or actual business relation. Due to the nature of these relationships, the precise collection and use of personal information can vary. All such individuals who are California residents can request additional information about our privacy practices with respect to their information, as well as make the access, deletion, correction and opt-out requests described above, by contacting us as directed above. Please provide sufficient information that we can identify you, and be aware that we may employ a more extensive authentication process to verify your identity before responding to your request. Do Not Track. Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference you can set in most browsers but there is no standard interpretation or practice for responding to DNT signals (see https://allaboutdnt.com/ for more information), and we therefore handle all user information consistent with our privacy policy. Direct Marketing. We do not share personal information such as your contact information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Additional Disclosures for Nevada residents We do not “sell” personal information as defined by Nevada law (Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 603A, Section 1.6). You can submit a request to us regarding the sale of such information via the contact information above. Cross Border Data Transfers If you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, due to the provision of Services being provided from and data storage facilities being located in the United States. Whenever we transfer personal information internationally, we use legal mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to ensure data transfers comply with applicable law. Retention of Information We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services subject to our legal obligations to further retain such information. Information associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until your account is deleted or becomes inactive. In making these determinations, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the purposes for which the personal information is processed, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements. In addition, you can delete some items of information (e.g., profile information) and you can remove individual activities from view on the Services without deleting your account. For example, if you withdraw your consent to Strava processing your health-related information, Strava will delete all health-related information from any future activities you upload. Following your deletion of your account, it may take up to 45 days to fully delete your personal information and system logs from our systems. Additionally, we may retain information to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the Terms of Service and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Personal information that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services to you may be de-identified and aggregated with other non-personal information to provide insights that are valuable to Strava, such as statistics of the use of the Services. For example, we may retain publicly available segments or routes and other depersonalized geolocation information to continue to improve the Services, and we use Aggregated Information in Strava Metro and our Global Heatmap. This information will be de-associated from your name and other identifiers. Other Strava Sites Strava maintains certain websites that can be accessed outside of https://strava.com, such as https://stories.strava.com, https://partners.strava.com, https://press.strava.com, https://partners.strava.com/business, https://support.strava.com, or https://communityhub.strava.com (the “Other Sites”). The Other Sites may maintain the look and feel of the Services, but may be hosted by Strava’s service providers with their own additional terms and privacy policies. If you interact with the Other Sites, your information may be stored, processed, or shared outside of the Services. If you interact with the Other Sites, you acknowledge that you may be subject to the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such Other Sites, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. Privacy Policy Updates Strava reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes to this privacy statement we will post the revised privacy statement and its effective date on this website.

The Talkspace therapy experience is enhanced by advanced data processing activities, carried out in order to measure and improve clinical outcomes. Our proprietary matching algorithm and machine-learning tools provide real-time engagement insights, inform treatment, and track clinical progress, and are fundamental to our precision therapy care delivery model. Matching Algorithm. During onboarding we ask you to provide information so that we can assess your condition and incorporate your preferences. We then leverage a proprietary algorithm (and/or support from a Talkspace consultant) to match you to a provider. Optimizing Diagnosis and Treatment. Throughout your experience, your provider uses the Talkspace Services to manage your diagnosis and treatment plan. The advanced machine learning features of our proprietary Services include natural language processing of communications with therapists. A core focus of our machine learning strategy is to provide the therapist with insights on patient needs and behaviours and offer techniques and suggestions that we believe are likely to maximize clinical outcomes. We also use advanced machine learning features to generate therapy notes where requested by our therapists. Separate and apart from internal healthcare operations and quality assurance activities undertaken for the purpose of delivering and optimizing patient care on the platform, from time to time, Talkspace conducts or participates in research studies with select universities. You may be offered the opportunity to participate in these studies. If your protected health information will be disclosed as part of these studies, your information will only be included with your written authorization. You will be asked to review and accept terms and enrollment separately from the information included in this Policy. Information from these studies may be published by third parties including through various media platforms/academic journals. See our Notice of Privacy Practices.

By clicking on that logo on the WebMD Sites or following the instructions in the flagship WebMD App, you will be presented with a window that will identify all of the companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you, both on the WebMD Sites and in the flagship WebMD App as well as on third-party websites. If you would like to stop this tailored advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that window. Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements through the Services. Please note that your choice to stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or mobile device too. By clicking the + symbol next to the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements. The WebMD Sites do not respond to web browser ""do not track"" signals. This opt-out mechanism is available in the flagship WebMD App for iOS and Android, as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD Allergy).

In certain cases, users may also re-share or pin posts that you share and add commentary. You should be aware that any information shared in a public or community forum such as a message board, blog, personal page, posting, group, bulletin board, public profile, or recipe swap is public information and may be seen or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. Although the availability of personal pages or groups identified as “private” may be limited to certain permitted users, even information or profiles marked “private” may be viewed by our personnel. You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any public forum, or through a public profile, including those available on our Website and App. In addition, with your consent, we publish testimonials on our Website and in other materials. THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHEN INFORMATION IS SHARED ON OUR PUBLIC FORUMS OR WHEN YOU PROVIDE INFORMATION (INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION) THROUGH PUBLIC PROFILE FEATURES OR THROUGH ANY COMMUNITY AREA OR PUBLIC FORUM. As noted above, our Website and App have features such as cookies and pixels that are used to track your activity on or interactions with the Websites and App, and other websites that you visit. Information gathered through these technologies are shared with third-party web analytics providers, advertising networks, and Social Media Platforms. Consistent with your choices, we share information, including sensitive Personal Information, with these third parties to understand how users interact with our Website and App and to provide you with advertisements that we and/or these third parties believe will be relevant to you. We may disclose Personal Information if we believe we are required to do so to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule, or law; a subpoena; a search warrant; a court or regulatory order; or other valid legal process. We may also disclose Personal Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms & Conditions, our Subscription Agreement, or the law, or where we believe disclosing such information is necessary to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website, or the public. We may disclose Personal Information to third parties in connection with a change to the control or financial status of the company, including a corporate restructuring, sale, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, transfer, or assignment of assets or business merger or divestiture. The Service, including our Website and App, contains links to other websites not owned or operated by WW (for example, if you “click” on a link to one of our social media pages, you will be taken off our Website and to the social media platform), including links to websites operated by franchisees of WW. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the Service links. The inclusion of a link on the Service does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the App or our Social Media Pages. We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the below. We give you choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out. Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Please note that we do not interpret or respond to the “Do Not Track” browser-based signal. However, we recognize the Global Privacy Control as a valid request from you to opt out of advertising and certain analytics cookies. You may also set your browser to not accept new cookies or web beacons, be notified when you receive a new cookie, or reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the “Help” section of the toolbar. Please note that if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website (including our products). Upon request, WW will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Information.

Unless otherwise required by law, such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will not affect other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change, or deletion. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our systems. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of Personal Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. In addition, in some cases we may be required to maintain certain information to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. After receiving your request, Personal Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed, or deleted, as appropriate and to the extent permitted or required by law. We retain your information for various purposes as allowed by law, including to ensure that we can continue to provide our services to you as requested, that we respect your opt-out wishes into the future, and that we can comply with our legal obligations. These disclosures are intended to supplement this Privacy Policy with information for residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia.
