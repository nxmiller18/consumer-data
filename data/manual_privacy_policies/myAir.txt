3. How we obtain your Personal Data
Direct collection of Personal Data
Most of the Personal Data we process is obtained either from you, directly through the ResMed therapy device and mask that monitors your sleep or automatically from your smart device (for example, phone or tablet) or your computer via cookies and other similar technology.
Specifically, the Personal Data we collect automatically may include your IP address, therapy device type, unique therapy device identification numbers (for example, IMEI number), operating system version, the dates on which you access and use the Service, user behavior (for example, your interactions with the Service), broad geographic location (for example, country- or city-level location) and other technical information.
Cookies and other technologies
When you interact with the Service, we may use tools, such as cookies and other technologies such as FirebaseTM Analytics and Google AnalyticsTM to understand how you are using the Service. We may use other tracking technologies within email messages we deliver to you related to the Service. We do this to help us measure the effectiveness of our communications to you by understanding how you use our Service, where you are located and what Service content you are most interested in. For example, we want to make sure emails that include coaching information are getting your attention. The only information we receive is whether emails are opened and if links within the email are clicked. These technologies are known as "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs."
The cookies and other technologies referenced above are "turned on" by default. By using the Service, you are consenting to our use of these tools and technologies. You may revoke your consent to our use of these tools, at any time, through your account settings.

You can learn more about our information security practices at https://me.resmed.com/security/.
Despite the security measures employed by us, you must consider that it’s impossible to guarantee absolute security with respect to information sent over the internet.

Transfer of data between ResMed entities is covered by appropriate data sharing agreements that are in place between all ResMed entities that share and process Personal Data.
