Privacy Policy
ManagingLife Inc.'s Privacy Policy
Version 2.2, Last Updated: February 22, 2024


ManagingLife, Inc. (“ManagingLife,” “we,” or “us”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information that we collect through:
* Websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “Websites”);
* Software applications, such as the Manage My Pain app, made available by us (the “Apps”);
* Our pages on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, (collectively, our “Social Media Pages”);
* Emails we send to you that link to this Privacy Policy or other communications with you (collectively, our “Communications”); and
* Offline business interactions you have with us.
Collectively, we refer to the Websites, Apps, Social Media Pages, Communications, and offline business interactions as the “Services.”




OFFLINE AND ONLINE MODE


You can use our Apps in offline and online mode. In the offline mode, which is the standard setting, your information is stored only on your device, and is not accessed by us. In the offline mode, the Apps allow you to manage your own information on your own device. Certain functionalities of the Apps require that information is shared and are therefore not available in offline mode. This is, for example, the sharing of your pain records with a health care provider of your choice, or generating pain reports. You can switch from offline mode to online mode by creating an account and logging into your Apps account, and back to offline mode by logging out of your Apps account.




PERSONAL INFORMATION


“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual.




The Apps collect crash reports, which can be turned off in the “Settings” menu and include the following Personal Information:
* User ID
* Device information (such as your device’s make and model)
* App version


When you contact us via any of our Services, we collect the following Personal Information:
* Email address
* User ID
* Device information (such as your device’s make and model)
* App version


If you choose to use the Apps in online mode, we collect Personal Information including:
* Account information (such as, your email address, IP address, and password);
* Profile information you choose to include (such as, name, medications, pain conditions, birthdate, height, weight, gender, and place of residence);
* Pain records and daily reflections you choose to create (which may include information such as, location, associated symptoms, characteristics, aggravating/alleviating factors, timing, environment, severity, meaningful activities and notes); and
* Responses you choose to submit for questionnaires assigned to you.




Collection of Personal Information


We and our service providers collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:




* Through the Services.
We collect Personal Information through the Services, for example, when you register an account to access the Services, use the Apps, share information via the Apps in online mode, contact customer service.




* From Other Sources.
If you choose to create an account on the Services and sign in by using another service provider such as Apple, Google or Facebook, you share certain Personal Information from that service provider with us, for example, your name, email address, or photo, or other information you make accessible to us when you connect your social media account to your Apps account.


We need to collect Personal Information to provide the requested Services to you. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide all the Services. If you disclose any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

THIRD PARTY SERVICES


This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EEA: Some non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here).

THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE


The Services may provide functionality allowing you to make payments to the Company using third-party payment services with which you have created your own account. When you use such a service to make a payment to us, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
