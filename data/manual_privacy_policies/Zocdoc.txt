HIPAA and PHI
Certain demographic, health and/or health-related information that Zocdoc collects about Users on behalf of our Healthcare Providers as part of providing the Services may be “protected health information” (“PHI”) governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Specifically, this may be true when (i) Zocdoc is providing administrative, operational, or other services to a Healthcare Provider that is a “Covered Entity” (as defined by HIPAA); and (ii) in order to provide those services, Zocdoc receives identifiable information about a User on behalf of the Healthcare Provider, where Zocdoc is acting as a “Business Associate” (as defined by HIPAA); and (iii) this identifiable information is regulated as PHI.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to PHI, which is instead regulated by HIPAA. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. Please read the Notice of Privacy Practices of your Healthcare Provider to understand how your PHI can be used and disclosed.
Personal data that a User provides to Zocdoc when Zocdoc is not acting as a Business Associate is not PHI and Zocdoc’s use of this information is therefore covered by this Privacy Policy. To provide just a few examples, we are collecting personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you (i) create an account, (ii) search for Healthcare Providers or available appointments with Healthcare Providers; (iii) post reviews; (iv) provide device/IP Information or Web Analytics information by browsing our websites (see below); or (v) direct your Covered Entity healthcare provider to disclose PHI to Zocdoc outside of its Business Associate capacity (e.g. pursuant to a HIPAA Authorization or access request).
Categories of Personal Data We Collect
Each table below details the categories of Personal Data that we may collect and may have collected about you over the past twelve (12) months, depending on your relationship with Zocdoc. Please note that multiple tables may apply to you depending on how you interact with us or our Services. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual, and includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. For each category of Personal Data, these subsections also set out the source of that Personal Data, our commercial or business purpose for collecting that Personal Data, and the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Data. More information regarding those sources and categories are set forth below.

Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out
The following sections provide additional information about how we collect your Personal Data.
Cookies
The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, mobile identifiers, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your device and web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services. We do this to analyze trends, learn about and advertise to our user base, and operate and improve our Services. For example, we use Cookies to tailor the Services or customize advertisements on and off of our Service by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customizing user experiences with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).
We use the following types of Cookies:
* Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required to provide you with features or services you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into the secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.
* Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services, how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and text typed into the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns to help us improve our campaigns and the content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on page.
* Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests to provide advertising on and off of our Service that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.”
* Web Beacons. Web Beacons (e.g., clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a webpage or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the web services of selected advertisers, and the emails, special promotions, or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers’ web services or opening emails, and for what purpose. Also, it allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).
* Mobile Device Identifiers. Mobile device identifiers help Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile devices and data, activities occurring on and through it, and the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable the collection of Personal Data, such as media access control, address, location, and tracking data, including without limitation IP address, domain server, type of device(s) used to access the Services, web browser(s) used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, other statistics, and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services.
* Cross Device Matching. To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data). We may also provide de-identified data to these partners to supplement this analysis. Based on this data, we may display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.
You can opt-out of all unessential Cookies at any time here. You can also decide whether to accept Cookies through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You may also be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your device. Although you are not required to accept Zocdoc’s Cookies, if you block, reject, or delete them, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you access the Services, as some functionalities may not work.
To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu. To find more information about Cookies, including how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit here.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. We generally do not support “Do Not Track” requests sent from a browser at this time. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit here. However, if you are a resident of state with an applicable privacy law, we treat opt-out preference signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal data, or of opting out of the processing of personal data for targeted advertising, as applicable, to the extent such signals are present and readable.
Information about Interest-Based Advertisements
We may serve advertisements and allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to collect data on the Services and serve advertisements on and off of the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you or derived or inferred from the online activity or usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may include IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, webpage interactions, geographic location, and demographic information, such as gender and age range. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including Web Beacons, from an ad network to you through the Services. Web Beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. This information helps Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web Beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a webpage from their site.
Please note that even after opting out of Interest-Based Ads, you may still see Zocdoc advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you).
Data Security
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we process that data. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.
For example, the Services use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data. We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad. We maintain what we consider industry-standard backup and archival systems. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanisms; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, for example, by making good faith efforts to store Personal Data in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot and do not guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.
Data Retention
We retain Personal Data about you as necessary to provide our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, provide our Services, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in a de-identified and/or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
For example:
* We retain your account information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
* We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively, and efficiently.
* We retain any PHI consistent with our obligations under our Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities and HIPAA.
Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to or intended for use by anyone under 18 years of age.If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. By accessing, using, and/or submitting information to or through the Services, you represent that you are at least the age of 18. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have received any Personal Data directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving their parent’s verified consent, we will use that Personal Data only to respond directly to that child (or their parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that they cannot use the Services. We will then subsequently delete that child’s Personal Data. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at Privacy@zocdoc.com.
If you are between the age 13 and 18, you may use the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, in compliance with the Agreement, use the Services on behalf of such minor child. Any information that you provide us while using the Services on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Data as otherwise provided herein.
If you use the Services on behalf of another person, regardless of age, you agree that Zocdoc may contact you for any communication made in connection with providing the Services or any legally required communications. You further agree to forward or share any such communication with any person for whom you are using the Services on behalf of.
Controlling Your Personal Data and Notifications
If you are a registered User of the Services, you can modify certain Personal Data or account information by logging in and accessing your account. If you wish to close your account, please e-mail us at Privacy@zocdoc.com. Zocdoc will use reasonable efforts to delete your account as soon as reasonably possible. Please note, however, that Zocdoc reserves the right to retain information from closed accounts consistent with our internal data retention policies and procedures.
You must promptly notify us if any of your account data is lost, stolen, or used without permission.
California Rights and Disclosures
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Data. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how California residents can exercise these rights. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at Consumer-Privacy@zocdoc.com and indicate “California Rights” in the subject line of your communication.Because of the minimal Personal Data we collect and retain about Visitors, certain rights may not be afforded to you (as further described below). Additionally, please note that these rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions under applicable law, which may permit or require us to deny your request. Lastly, we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a “service provider” under the CCPA, you may need to contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
Access
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data, including the following:
* The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
* The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
* The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
* The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each third-party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data purchased by third-party recipients.
Deletion
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
Correction
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, if we decide, based on the totality of circumstances related to your Personal Data, that such data is correct. If your correction request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your request.
Processing of Sensitive Personal Data Opt-Out
If you have a Zocdoc account, we may collect Personal Data that is considered “sensitive” under the CCPA. Because we may use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those set forth in section 7027(m) of the CCPA regulations, California residents have the right to request that we limit the use or sharing of their Sensitive Personal Information (“Right to Limit”). The Right to Limit allows California residents to direct a business that collects Sensitive Personal Information to limit its use of this information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services, to perform the services set forth in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), and (8) of subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140, and as authorized in the CCPA regulations.
Personal Data Sharing or Selling
Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights when a business “shares” or “sells” Personal Data with third parties for purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising. While Zocdoc does not sell Users’ information to unaffiliated parties for money, we do share Cookies and other web data to advertising and marketing partners in a manner which might be considered “selling” or “sharing” your Personal Data as those terms are defined under the CCPA. Accordingly, we have shared and sold the foregoing categories of Personal Data for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising:
* User Demographic data (not Sensitive Demographic Data) such as gender or zipcode;
* Online Identifiers

If you are a Healthcare Provider with a profile on our Services, you do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will respond to your Valid Request within the applicable time period required by law.

In addition to Users who create a Zocdoc account to use the Services, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Users” also includes users of our Services who do not have a Zocdoc account (for example, if you visit our websites or download our mobile application without creating a Zocdoc account) (“Visitors”).

HIPAA and PHI
Certain demographic, health and/or health-related information that Zocdoc collects about Users on behalf of our Healthcare Providers as part of providing the Services may be “protected health information” (“PHI”) governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Specifically, this may be true when (i) Zocdoc is providing administrative, operational, or other services to a Healthcare Provider that is a “Covered Entity” (as defined by HIPAA); and (ii) in order to provide those services, Zocdoc receives identifiable information about a User on behalf of the Healthcare Provider, where Zocdoc is acting as a “Business Associate” (as defined by HIPAA); and (iii) this identifiable information is regulated as PHI.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to PHI, which is instead regulated by HIPAA. HIPAA provides specific protections for the privacy and security of PHI and restricts how PHI is used and disclosed. Please read the Notice of Privacy Practices of your Healthcare Provider to understand how your PHI can be used and disclosed.
Personal data that a User provides to Zocdoc when Zocdoc is not acting as a Business Associate is not PHI and Zocdoc’s use of this information is therefore covered by this Privacy Policy. To provide just a few examples, we are collecting personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you (i) create an account, (ii) search for Healthcare Providers or available appointments with Healthcare Providers; (iii) post reviews; (iv) provide device/IP Information or Web Analytics information by browsing our websites (see below); or (v) direct your Covered Entity healthcare provider to disclose PHI to Zocdoc outside of its Business Associate capacity (e.g. pursuant to a HIPAA Authorization or access request).
Categories of Personal Data We Collect
Each table below details the categories of Personal Data that we may collect and may have collected about you over the past twelve (12) months, depending on your relationship with Zocdoc. Please note that multiple tables may apply to you depending on how you interact with us or our Services. “Personal Data” means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual, and includes information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. For each category of Personal Data, these subsections also set out the source of that Personal Data, our commercial or business purpose for collecting that Personal Data, and the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Data. More information regarding those sources and categories are set forth below.

Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out
The following sections provide additional information about how we collect your Personal Data.
Cookies


The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, mobile identifiers, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your device and web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services. We do this to analyze trends, learn about and advertise to our user base, and operate and improve our Services. For example, we use Cookies to tailor the Services or customize advertisements on and off of our Service by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customizing user experiences with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).
We use the following types of Cookies:
* Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required to provide you with features or services you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into the secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.
* Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services, how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and text typed into the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns to help us improve our campaigns and the content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on page.
* Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests to provide advertising on and off of our Service that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.”
* Web Beacons. Web Beacons (e.g., clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a webpage or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Services, the web services of selected advertisers, and the emails, special promotions, or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using selected publishers’ web services or opening emails, and for what purpose. Also, it allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).
* Mobile Device Identifiers. Mobile device identifiers help Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile devices and data, activities occurring on and through it, and the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable the collection of Personal Data, such as media access control, address, location, and tracking data, including without limitation IP address, domain server, type of device(s) used to access the Services, web browser(s) used to access the Services, referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Services, other statistics, and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Services.
* Cross Device Matching. To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we may work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data). We may also provide de-identified data to these partners to supplement this analysis. Based on this data, we may display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Services across devices.

However, if you are a resident of state with an applicable privacy law, we treat opt-out preference signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal data, or of opting out of the processing of personal data for targeted advertising, as applicable, to the extent such signals are present and readable.
Information about Interest-Based Advertisements


We may serve advertisements and allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to collect data on the Services and serve advertisements on and off of the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you or derived or inferred from the online activity or usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties. Such information may include IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, webpage interactions, geographic location, and demographic information, such as gender and age range. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including Web Beacons, from an ad network to you through the Services. Web Beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. This information helps Zocdoc learn more about our Users’ demographics and internet behaviors. Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web Beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a webpage from their site.
Please note that even after opting out of Interest-Based Ads, you may still see Zocdoc advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you).


Data Security
The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we process that data. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.
For example, the Services use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of Personal Data. We store and process your information on our servers in the United States and abroad. We maintain what we consider industry-standard backup and archival systems. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanisms; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, for example, by making good faith efforts to store Personal Data in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot and do not guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.


Data Retention
We retain Personal Data about you as necessary to provide our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, provide our Services, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in a de-identified and/or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.
For example:
* We retain your account information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
* We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively, and efficiently.
* We retain any PHI consistent with our obligations under our Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities and HIPAA.


Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to or intended for use by anyone under 18 years of age.If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. By accessing, using, and/or submitting information to or through the Services, you represent that you are at least the age of 18. As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have received any Personal Data directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving their parent’s verified consent, we will use that Personal Data only to respond directly to that child (or their parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that they cannot use the Services. We will then subsequently delete that child’s Personal Data. If you believe that a child under 18 may have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at Privacy@zocdoc.com.
If you are between the age 13 and 18, you may use the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may, in compliance with the Agreement, use the Services on behalf of such minor child. Any information that you provide us while using the Services on behalf of your minor child will be treated as Personal Data as otherwise provided herein.
If you use the Services on behalf of another person, regardless of age, you agree that Zocdoc may contact you for any communication made in connection with providing the Services or any legally required communications. You further agree to forward or share any such communication with any person for whom you are using the Services on behalf of.


Controlling Your Personal Data and Notifications
If you are a registered User of the Services, you can modify certain Personal Data or account information by logging in and accessing your account. If you wish to close your account, please e-mail us at Privacy@zocdoc.com. Zocdoc will use reasonable efforts to delete your account as soon as reasonably possible. Please note, however, that Zocdoc reserves the right to retain information from closed accounts consistent with our internal data retention policies and procedures.
You must promptly notify us if any of your account data is lost, stolen, or used without permission.


California Rights and Disclosures
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Data. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how California residents can exercise these rights. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at Consumer-Privacy@zocdoc.com and indicate “California Rights” in the subject line of your communication.Because of the minimal Personal Data we collect and retain about Visitors, certain rights may not be afforded to you (as further described below). Additionally, please note that these rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions under applicable law, which may permit or require us to deny your request. Lastly, we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a “service provider” under the CCPA, you may need to contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
Access
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data, including the following:
* The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
* The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.
* The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.
* The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each third-party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data purchased by third-party recipients.
Deletion
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.
Correction
If you have a Zocdoc account, you have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, if we decide, based on the totality of circumstances related to your Personal Data, that such data is correct. If your correction request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your request.
Processing of Sensitive Personal Data Opt-Out
If you have a Zocdoc account, we may collect Personal Data that is considered “sensitive” under the CCPA. Because we may use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those set forth in section 7027(m) of the CCPA regulations, California residents have the right to request that we limit the use or sharing of their Sensitive Personal Information (“Right to Limit”). The Right to Limit allows California residents to direct a business that collects Sensitive Personal Information to limit its use of this information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services, to perform the services set forth in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), and (8) of subdivision (e) of Section 1798.140, and as authorized in the CCPA regulations.
Personal Data Sharing or Selling
Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights when a business “shares” or “sells” Personal Data with third parties for purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising. While Zocdoc does not sell Users’ information to unaffiliated parties for money, we do share Cookies and other web data to advertising and marketing partners in a manner which might be considered “selling” or “sharing” your Personal Data as those terms are defined under the CCPA. Accordingly, we have shared and sold the foregoing categories of Personal Data for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising:
* User Demographic data (not Sensitive Demographic Data) such as gender or zipcode;
* Online Identifiers
* Web analytics
As described in the “Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out” section above, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit. Under the laws of the CCPA, “sharing” of a User’s web analytics is also considered “selling.” You can opt out of such data selling and/or sharing by following the instructions in this section.
We share Personal Data with the following categories of third parties:
* Advertising partners
Over the past 12 months, we have shared Personal Data with the categories of third parties listed above for the following purposes:
* Marketing and advertising the Services.
* Showing you advertisements, including interest-based or online behavioral advertising.
Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sharing of your Personal Data for at least 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not share the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.
We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you with a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
Financial Incentives
At Zocdoc, we value your data because it allows us to better understand your goals and preferences and improve our products and services to better serve you. From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive for your participation in our user research. The financial incentive we offer is based on our good faith determination of the estimated value of your data. If you participate in the research, you may be asked to submit Personal Data in surveys, forms, or through your account. The Personal Data you submit in connection with this research will only be used internally to improve our product; we will never share or sell this data to third parties.
Through your participation in the research, we may collect the following categories of Personal Data about you:
* Identifiers, such as your name, address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, internet protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.
* Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law.
* Commercial information, such as products or services you’ve purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
* Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as your browsing history, search history, and information regarding your interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement.
* Geolocation data.
* Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information. For example, we may collect your voice recordings.
* Professional or employment-related information.

* Any other Personal Data you may enter into a free-form field of our surveys or forms.
* Inferences drawn from any of the foregoing categories of Personal Data.
Participation in the financial incentive is entirely optional. If you participate in a financial incentive, you agree that we are not required to comply with your right to know or delete Personal Data collected in exchange for the financial incentive. If you are a participant in a financial incentive we offer, you may withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by emailing us at the email address provided to you with your individual notice of the financial incentive.

Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request. If you are a Healthcare Provider with a profile on our Services, you do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.
We will respond to your Valid Request within the applicable time period required by law. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

To the extent rights are afforded to you, you may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:
* If you have a Zocdoc account, you can submit requests to access (by portable copy or otherwise), delete, correct through the “Privacy” tab in your account settings.
* If you have a Zocdoc account, you can opt-out from or limit the processing of sensitive information through the “Data Privacy” tab in your account settings.
