This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect, how we use and share Personal Data, and your choices concerning our Personal Data practices. We employ a number of technical, organisational and physical safeguards that are designed to protect the Personal Data we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data. Please read this Privacy Policy before using our Service or submitting any Personal Data to AllTrails and contact us if you have any questions.
Information We Collect
When you contact us or interact with our Service, we collect information about you (including that which otherwise constitutes ‘personal data’ or similarly defined term under applicable laws) (“Personal Data”) as follows:
* Personal Data You Provide to Us: We collect Personal Data when you sign up for our Service via the Site or an AllTrails App. The Personal Data collected during these interactions may vary based on what you choose to share with us, but it may include any of the following:
   * Account Data: When you sign up, some information is required to create an account on our Service, such as your name and email address.
   * Payment Data: If you choose to purchase a subscription to our Service via credit card, debit card or other payment method, our third-party payments processors (Stripe or PayPal) will collect and process certain payment and billing information, such as billing postcode, payment card details and authentication features, on behalf of AllTrails. That information is collected by our payment processors directly, and we do not collect or store it. If you have any questions about how our payment processors protect such information, please read Stripe’s services agreement and privacy policy as well as PayPal’s services agreement and privacy policy.
   * Social Media Data: We have pages (“Social Media Pages”) on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn (each a “Social Media Site”). The platforms that host our Social Media Pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics regarding the use of our Social Media Pages. Additionally, should you choose to interact with any of our Social Media Pages, we may collect Personal Data that you provide or make available via our Social Media Pages.
   * User-Generated Content: User-generated content, such as photos, images, videos, community posts, reviews, community comments, and other content or information that you generate, transmit or otherwise make available on the Service, as well as associated metadata. Metadata includes information about how, when, where and by whom a piece of content was collected and how that content has been formatted or edited. Metadata also includes information that users can add or can have added to their content, such as keywords, geographical or location information, and other similar data.
   * Contacts Book Data: Our mobile applications may allow you to synchronise the numbers in your Contacts address book on a regular basis in order to identify any friends and/or relatives who use the Service. If any of your contacts are using the Service, we will let you know so that you can connect with them. You can revoke our access to your Contacts address book at any time via your mobile device settings.
   * Additional Information: To customise your experience or enable certain features of the Service, you may choose to provide us with additional information, such as your date of birth, height, weight, profile picture, location (city) and favourite activities. 
   * Sensitive Personal Data: In the course of using the Service on our App, you may choose to allow us to collect sensitive Personal Data about you, such as your precise geolocation, by turning on location services on your mobile device, which may be considered ‘sensitive personal information’ (or a similarly defined term) under certain applicable laws. Turning on location services on your mobile device constitutes consent for us to collect your precise geolocation. You can disallow our collection of precise geolocation data by turning off location services on your mobile device at any time. You may also choose to share other sensitive Personal Data via the content you share on our Site, for example, when leaving a review, or otherwise sharing information on our Site. By sharing this information, you consent to the collection of this sensitive Personal Data. You may limit the visibility of such sensitive Personal Data via our Privacy Settings; refer to our FAQs here for further information. We do not process sensitive Personal Data for purposes other than providing the Services.
* Personal Data We Generate From Your Use of Our Service: When you visit, use, interact and register with the Service, we may automatically generate certain information about your visit, use, interactions or registration. For example, we may monitor the number of people that visit our Site or AllTrails Apps, peak hours of visits, which page(s) are visited on our Site or AllTrails Apps, the domains our visitors come from (e.g. google.com, yahoo.com, etc.) and which browsers people use to access and visit our Site (e.g. Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.), broad geographical information, and Site- and AllTrails App-navigation pattern. In particular, the following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:
   * Log Data: Information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit the Site or AllTrails Apps.

   * Device Data: Includes the model of the device, operating system, and browser you are using. Information collected may depend on the type of device you use and its settings. We may also collect data from your device to estimate a variety of metrics like the time, frequency and duration of, and calories burned during, your activities for the purpose of calculating your Usage and Activity Data (described below).
   * Usage and Activity Data: We collect information about how you use our Site and AllTrails Apps, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, and the time, frequency and duration of, and calories burned during, your activities.
   * Geolocation Data: If you have enabled location services for an AllTrails App on your mobile device or on your computer via the Site, we may collect your geolocation information based on IP address, city, county, postcode, country, latitude and longitude. AllTrails may also derive your approximate location from the IP address of your computer or mobile device. Geolocation data is used for purposes of directing you to nearby trails and parks and offering other relevant content and services. We do not process Geolocation Data unless you grant permission through your device or browser.
   * Inferences about You. We may combine the information we collect and otherwise generate or draw inferences about your preferences and interests in order to provide and personalise our Service to you, such as trail suggestions and estimated calories burned during activities.

Applicable state privacy laws may classify our use of some of these services as ‘selling’ or ‘sharing’ your Personal Data with the advertising partners that provide the services. You can submit requests to opt out of tracking for targeted advertising purposes using GPC opt-out preference signals (as described above) by clicking the ‘Manage Cookies’ link at the bottom of our homepage or by contacting privacy@alltrails.com.
                                                      * Verification of identity. Once we receive your request, we will require you to verify your identity in order to process your request. To verify your identity, we require you to respond to an email that we send to the email address associated with your AllTrails account. We require identity verification through email authentication before privacy requests can be processed as we require only limited information in order to create an account and, as a result, it is difficult to verify your identity even if we collect additional information. If we are unable to verify your identity through email authentication, we will be unable to complete your request.
Under some state privacy laws, you may enable an authorised agent to make a request on your behalf. However, we may need to verify your authorised agent’s identity and authority to act on your behalf. We may require a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorised agent pursuant to applicable law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorised, such as by providing your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your state privacy law rights on your behalf, the information we request to verify your identity and confirmation that you have given the authorised agent permission to submit the request.

Legal Bases for Processing. This Privacy Policy (the ‘How We Use Personal Data’ section) describes the legal bases we rely on for the processing of your Personal Data where required by applicable law.  For any sensitive Personal Data we process, we also have to establish a condition to process such data. The only sensitive Personal Data we may process is identified in the ‘Information We Collect’ section of this Privacy Policy above. 
Your Rights. Pursuant to applicable privacy laws in the EEA and the UK, you have the following rights in relation to your Personal Data, under certain circumstances:
                                                         * Right of access: If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data and, if so, provide you with a copy of that Personal Data along with certain other details.
                                                         * Right to rectification: If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to ask that we correct or complete it. If we shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the correction where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so you can contact them directly.
                                                         * Right to erasure: You may ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data, such as where you withdraw your consent. If we shared your data with others, we will tell them about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data with so you can contact them directly.
                                                         * Right to restrict processing: You may ask us to restrict or ‘block’ the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it (please read below for information on your right to object). We will tell you before we lift any restriction on processing. If we shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the restriction where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so you can contact them directly.
                                                         * Right to data portability: You have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data from us, to the extent that it is processed by automated means. We will give you a copy of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You may reuse it elsewhere.
                                                         * Right to object: You may ask us to stop processing your Personal Data, and we will do so:
                                                         * If we are relying on a Legitimate Interest to process your Personal Data, unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or we need to process your Personal Data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                                                         * If we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing, we may keep minimum information about you in a suppression list in order to ensure that your choices are respected in the future and to comply with data protection laws. (Such processing is necessary for our and your legitimate interest in pursuing the purposes described above.)
                                                         * Right to withdraw consent: If we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect any processing of your data before we received notice that you wished to withdraw consent.
                                                         * Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority: If you have a concern about our privacy practices, including the way we handled your Personal Data, you can report it to your local data protection authority.
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
To confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data, you will need to verify your identity through email authentication. If you are unable to authenticate your email address, we may be unable to complete your request. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month of receipt. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
If you would like to exercise any or all of these rights, you may do so by clicking ‘Make a Privacy Request’ or contacting privacy@alltrails.com. If you have shared Personal Data with us via our Social Media Pages, you may contact the Social Media Site regarding the rights you may have under their applicable privacy policies and terms.

Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of your country of residence, we endeavour to ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing appropriate safeguards.
