We collect information that you provide to us, including any information provided when you interact with us in any way via the Services, email, a phone call, events, or otherwise. For example, we collect information from and about you when you create an account, upload or input information to the Services, or engage with customer support.
The information you provide to us may include, but is not limited to:
? Contact information, such as your full name and/or alias, email address, physical address, and phone number.
? Login information, such as username and password.
? Health information, such as information about your vital signs, diet, nutrition, sleep, exercise, and other bodily and physiological functions, including through integrations with wearable devices.

If you make purchases on the Services, your payment information is collected and managed by third-party payment processors, not Blueprint. We do not collect or store your full payment information. As noted above, we may collect your purchase or transaction history.
You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Services may not be accessible or available absent the provision of the requested information.
Information Collected Automatically
When you interact with the Services, we and third parties may collect information about your browser, device, and use of the Services, including but not limited to your IP address, device type and model, operating system, unique device identifier, cookie identifiers, other device or online identifiers, browser type, language, frequency of use of the Services, web logs, crash reporting, Site pages visited, and navigation through those pages. We may also collect technical information when you interact with emails or other communications from us (e.g., whether you opened an email). Some of this information is collected using cookies or other similar technologies. For more information, see the "Your Rights and Choices" section below.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may collect information about you from our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries.
We may also collect information about your interactions with Blueprint on third-party platforms, including our social media accounts. This information includes, but is not limited to, your likes and shares of our content.
If you log into the Services using your social media credentials, we may collect information about you from the social media site based on the authorizations and permissions set with the social media site. Logging into the Services through social media credentials is optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect.
We store some information that we receive from social media sites with other information that we collect about you. The social media site controls the information that it collects from you. For information about how the social media site may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult its privacy policy. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.
If you choose to connect the Services to third-party platforms or tools, or with other apps on your device (e.g., health or fitness monitoring platforms or tools, or your contacts, photos, or calendar), such third parties and tools may allow us to have access to and store additional information as it relates to your use of the Services (e.g., to integrate your fitness data within the Services). If you do not wish to have this information disclosed, do not initiate these connections.
Please note that the App may collect certain information when it is not open on your device. For example, if you have integrated the App with a fitness app, and that fitness app records a workout, the App will collect this workout data even if the App is not open at the time the data is generated.
How We Use Information
We use the information we collect for various purposes, depending on the type of information and the way you interact with the Services, including:
? To provide, manage, and improve the Services;
? To administer your account, including to process your registration and verify your information;
? To personalize the Services;
? To process transactions (as explained above, payment information is collected and processed by a third-party payment processor, not by us);
? To communicate with you about your use of our Services, to respond to your inquiries, to fulfill your orders, and for other customer service purposes, which may include communicating with you via email;
? To engage in analysis and research regarding the use of our Services;

We may combine information that we collect from and about you (including automatically generated information) with information that we obtain about you from other sources and use such combined information in accordance with this Policy.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services. We may use and disclose appropriately aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose.
The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds they rely on to process your information. Our legal bases for processing your information as described in this Policy are (1) where the processing is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract or commitment to you; (2) where the processing furthers the legitimate interests of Blueprint or others; (3) where the processing is necessary to comply with applicable legal obligations; or (4) where you have consented to our processing of your information for a particular purpose.

The laws of your jurisdiction of residence may provide you with certain rights with regard to your information. These rights may include the right to request:
? Access to, or a copy of, your information;
? Confirmation that we are processing your information and information about how we use and disclose your information;
? Correction or amendment of your information;
? Deletion of your information;

Many of the rights described above are subject to limitations or exceptions under applicable law. For example, if you ask us to delete information that we are legally required to retain, we may deny your request. We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to your request, including by asking you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify you.
In some cases (e.g., if you are an EEA or UK resident), you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country of residence, but we encourage you to contact us first, as we would like to do our best to resolve any concern you may have.
Marketing Communications
You may use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of emails we send to you to opt out of receiving future marketing emails. If you are currently receiving SMS/text messages from us and wish to opt out of receiving such messages, you may do so by replying STOP. You can also notify us of your desire to opt out of marketing via phone calls or direct mail using the information in the "Contact Us" section below. We process requests to be placed on do-not-mail, do-not-phone, and do-not-contact lists as required by applicable law.
Note that if you opt out of marketing communications, you may continue to receive certain non-promotional communications about services you request or engage with (e.g., a confirmation of purchase email) and service-related communications regarding us and our Services and opting out of marketing communications will not halt those communications (e.g., communications regarding our Services or updates to our legal terms, including this Policy).
Cookies
We and third parties use cookies and other similar technologies (such as web beacons and pixels) to collect information about your use of our Services. Cookies are files that are stored on your device through your web browser. Web beacons and pixels, which we may place on our Services and in our emails, operate in your browser or in your email program and can run operations on your device (such as reading and writing cookies) and can send information from your device to us or third parties. Cookies and similar technologies perform a variety of functions, including enabling the Services to function, securing the Services, personalizing the Services, helping us analyze and understand use of the Services, and assisting with advertising and marketing.
You can disable cookies through your browser or device settings. Please consult your browser "Help" menu and device settings for more information. Certain cookies ("essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies) may not be disabled as they are essential for the Services to function. If you disable cookies using a browser or device setting, that setting will apply only to the browser or device you are using, so you will need to reset the setting on a different browser or device. If you disable some or all cookies, the Services may not function as intended and some features may be unavailable.
Online Analytics
We and our vendors may use third-party analytics services on the Services to help us understand how users engage with the Services, including Google Analytics. These parties may use cookies and other technologies to help collect, analyze, and provide us with reports and/or data. For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please visit: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
Tailored Advertising
We and third parties may use the information we collect to tailor the advertising you see online. You have choices about how information about you is used for this purpose.
Some tailored advertising is carried out using cookies and similar technologies.
For Services offered via an Internet browser, you may be able to set your browser to refuse certain types of cookies or alert you when they are being used, as explained above. In addition, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of tailored advertising and your choices regarding having information used by companies participating in the DAA. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of tailored advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members. We make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of these opt-out mechanisms.
For Services offered via mobile devices, including our App, mobile devices often include settings to help you manage how your device collects and discloses information for advertising purposes. For more information on how to manage those devices settings, please visit the NAI's mobile choice page. You may also visit the DAA's AppChoices page for information about the DAA's AppChoices tool. We make no representation about the accuracy or effectiveness of these opt-out mechanisms.
Modifying your browser or device settings or opting out of tailored advertising via your browser or device may have different results depending on the type of device or web browser you use and the version of your device operating system. Opting out of tailored advertising does not prevent you from seeing ads online; instead, the ads you see are less likely to be customized to your interests. Opting out is generally effective only on a device-by-device, or browser-by-browser basis. If you use more than one browser or device, the effect of any opt-out mechanism may be limited to the device on which you used the mechanism.
"Do Not Track"
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a setting that users can enable in certain web browsers. DNT signals do not have a commonly agreed-upon meaning and we do not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals.
Security
Although we take certain measures to protect your information, no method of security is perfect. By using our Services, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information, and that you provide information to us at your own risk. You are responsible for keeping your username and password confidential.
Data Retention
We may retain your information until we determine that retention no longer is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and retained, and as required by applicable law. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of information and the context and purpose of its collection and use.
Third-Party Links and Content
The Services may have links and embedded content to third-party websites, apps, or other digital properties that may have privacy policies that differ from ours. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties or their sites, apps, or properties. You should check their privacy policies to understand how they may handle your information.
Likewise, the Services may have third-party content. We do not make any representations concerning the accuracy of such information and are not responsible in any way for third-party content on our Services. You interact with third-party content at your own risk.
Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information (as defined in applicable law) from children under the age permitted by applicable law without parental consent. If we become aware that a child has disclosed information to us in a way that is prohibited by applicable children's privacy laws, we will delete such information in accordance with applicable law.
California "Shine the Light" Disclosure
The California "Shine the Light" law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes within the meaning of that law.
Information for Non-United States Residents
Please note that Blueprint is located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, you should be aware that any personal data you provide to us is transmitted to us and processed in the United States. Your information will be protected subject to this Policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country.
