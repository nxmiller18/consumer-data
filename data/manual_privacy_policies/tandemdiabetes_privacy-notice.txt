● We have a legal obligation to process your personal information, such as compliance with applicable tax and other government regulations or compliance with a court order or binding law enforcement request.
● The processing is to protect your vital interests, or those of others.
● We have a legitimate interest in carrying out the processing activity. In particular, we have a legitimate interest to:
○ Analyze and improve the safety and security of the Service. This includes implementing and enhancing security measures and safeguards and protecting against fraud, spam, and abuse.
○ Maintain and improve the Service.
○ Operate the Service and provide you with certain information and communications tailored to, and in accordance with, your preferences.
● You have consented to the processing of your personal information. When you consent, you may change your mind at any time.
Given the nature of our business, we may process special categories of your personal information in the form of health information. This information includes diabetes therapy data, such as your glucose levels, biometrics, related exercise and eating habits, and lab charts. We will only process this information in accordance with applicable law such as obtaining your explicit consent or where processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health.
Transfers of Personal Information for Data Subjects located in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland
Where we transfer your personal information to countries and territories outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, which have been formally recognized as providing an adequate level of protection for personal information, we rely on the relevant "adequacy decisions" from the European Commission, "adequacy regulations" from the Secretary of State in the UK, and the adequacy assessment from the Swiss Federal Council, as applicable (together referred to as "EEA/UK/Swiss adequacy decisions").
Some EEA /UK/Swiss adequacy decisions require Tandem to take steps in order for relevant transfers to be covered, in particular for transfers to the U.S. under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("EU-U.S. DPF"), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF ("UK Extension"), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("Swiss-U.S. DPF") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that they adhere to:
● the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles ("EU-U.S. DPF Principles") with regard to the processing of personal information received from the EEA in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the UK in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF; and
● the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles ("Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles") with regard to the processing of personal information received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.
To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework ("DPF") and to view our certification, see here. It is important however for us to provide you with the following information about our certification:
● We will only rely on the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF as transfer mechanisms under the applicable data protection laws, once respectively (i) the adequacy regulations implementing the data bridge for the UK Extension; and/or (ii) the Swiss Federal Council's recognition of adequacy of the Swiss-U.S. DPF, enter into force.
● We are responsible for the processing of personal information received under each DPF and, subsequently, transfers to a third party acting on our behalf. We comply with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal information we receive in reliance on the EU-U.S. / Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the UK Extension, including the onward transfer liability provisions. In particular, where we have received your personal information in the U.S. in reliance upon the EU-U.S. / Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the UK Extension, if we subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting on our behalf, and that third party processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, we will remain liable unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
● With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to each of the DPFs, Tandem is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
● If you want to contact us with any inquiries or complaints regarding our reliance on the DPFs, you can email us at privacy@tandemdiabetes.com or please see the How to Contact Us section at the end of this Privacy Notice.
● If you have an unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, you can contact the individual panel established by the EU DPAs and, as applicable, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) (and the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA)), and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) free of charge to make a complaint. Tandem commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of this panel. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF website you may also invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
Where the transfer is not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations, we take appropriate safeguards to require your personal information will remain protected. The safeguards we use under GDPR, include the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") as issued on 4 June 2021, in the form of modules 1 (controller to controller), module 2 (controller to processor), module 3 (processor to processor) and/or module 4 (processor to controller), as appropriate depending on our relationship with the recipient(s). We incorporate the UK's International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission SCCs as permitted under Article 46 of the UK GDPR, when transferring personal information protected under UK GDPR and the Swiss Addendum to the SCCs as provided by the FDPIC in its statement of 27 August 2021.
Our SCCs can be provided on request. Please note some sensitive commercial information may be redacted. For details of what personal information may be transferred to group entities or third parties, please see the Disclosing Your Information section of this Privacy Notice above.
In exceptional circumstances, personal information may also be transferred to countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision or regulations on the basis of a derogation. A derogation may apply, for example, in case of legal proceedings abroad, if transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract, if you have consented to the transfer, or if the data has been made generally available by you and you have not objected to the processing.
