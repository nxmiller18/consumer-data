This is called interest-based advertising. We may also share names, email addresses and device identifiers of our users with these companies to facilitate interest-based advertising to those or similar users on other online platforms.

State privacy rights notice
Certain states in the U.S., including, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia provide (now or in the future) their state residents with rights related to their Personal Information. Consistent with these laws, Although some of these rights apply generally, certain rights will only apply to limited individuals or circumstances. California residents should view the “California privacy rights notice” for information about their rights. To the extent that these laws apply, you may exercise the following rights:
Right to Know and Access. Note that much of the information you are entitled to know or access is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. With this said, you have the right to know about our information practices. You also have the right to access the categories of data we collect, with whom we share or sell that information, and, in some cases, what specific Personal Information we associate with you or your account.
Data Portability. If you request a copy of your specific Personal Information, then we will provide it in an easily accessible format.
Deletion. You may request that we delete the Personal Information we have collected about you. Depending on the applicable law, in some cases we are required or permitted to retain your Personal Information, even if you validly requested we delete or erase it.
Correction. You may request we correct or rectify inaccurate Personal Information we have collected about you.
Right to Opt out of Targeting Advertising, Sales, or Profiling. You may opt-out of our use of your Personal Information for targeted advertising, sales, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. Please note that we do not use Personal Information collected about you for automated profiling at this time. We are not making automated decisions about you. We may use profiling in regard to your Personal Information required to operate some of our services, for example, to the extent needed to predict health-related effects that you may experience from one month to the other, but currently for no other purposes. 
While traditionally we think of a “sale” to be an exchange of a product for money, data protection laws define this much more broadly. Many U.S. states specifically define a ‘sale” of Personal Information as an exchange of Personal Information with a third party for monetary or any other valuable consideration. Our use of cookies and other website tracking technologies may be considered a sale or sharing of Personal Information under applicable law, in which case the categories of Personal Information that we have sold or shared include identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) and internet or other similar network activity. Categories of third parties to whom Personal Information is sold or shared under the CPRA include data analytics providers and advertising and marketing providers.
We do not sell or share health information from our users.
You may submit these requests by email to privacy@glowing.com or at https://support.glowing.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360002386093.
For requests submitted by email, you must provide enough Personal Information that allows us to verify your identity. Only you or your authorized agent may make requests regarding your Personal Information. An authorized agent must have documentation that they are authorized to act on your behalf. We will fulfill or reject your request within the amount of time required by law.
Appeal. If we deny your rights request, you have the right to request an appeal of our decision. To initiate an appeal, follow the instructions provided in the communication denying your request, or contact us at the Personal Information provided in this Privacy Policy. 
Non-Discrimination. You have the right to not experience discrimination from us for exercising the rights listed in this section. What we mean by discrimination is denying you access to our Services or limiting the quality of our Services. However, limiting use of, or deleting, your Personal Information may restrict the purposes or uses that rely on that Personal Information.
California privacy rights notice
This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share Personal Information of California residents in our capacity as a “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.

You can object to such profiling by contacting us at support@glowing.com.
Your rights. European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. If you are located in Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold: 
* Access. Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
* Correct. Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.
* Delete. Delete your personal information where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be described to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
* Portability. Port a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice, in certain circumstances. Note that this right only applies to automated information for which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
* Restrict. Restrict the processing of your personal information, if, (i) you want us to establish the personal information’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the personal information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the personal information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
* Object. Object to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedom – you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
* Withdraw Consent. When we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

Cross-border data transfer. After collecting personal information directly from you, we further transfer your personal information to some recipients which may be located in countries in respect of which either the European Commission and/or UK Government (as and where applicable) has issued adequacy decisions, in which case, the recipient’s country is recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection under EEA/UK data protection laws (as applicable) and the transfer is therefore permitted under Article 45 of the GDPR.
Some recipients of your personal data may be located in countries outside the EEA and/or the UK for which the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) has not issued adequacy decisions in respect of the level of data protection in such countries (“Restricted Countries”). For example, the United States is a Restricted Country. Where we transfer your personal information to a recipient in a Restricted Country, we will either:
* enter into appropriate data transfer agreements based on so-called Standard Contractual Clauses approved from time-to-time under GDPR Art. 46 by the European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or UK Government (as and where applicable); or
* rely on other appropriate means permitted by the EU GDPR/UK GDPR, which establish that such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
You may ask for a copy of such appropriate data transfer agreements by contacting us using the contact details above.
