Third-Party Health Information


With your permission, our Services connect to third-party applications and services (the “Third-Party Applications”), which may include Apple Health, laboratory and testing services and other providers for whom you offer us permission to connect our Services. We connect to these Third-Party Applications solely for the purpose of importing certain health information about you. Such health information may include the following: heart rate, sleep information, movement and exercise activity, blood oxygen levels, respiratory rate, height, weight and age. If you permit our Services to access certain laboratory and testing services, then imported health information may include your results from such services, for example, blood test results. The health information you permit us to access in connection with the Services is collectively referred to as “Health Information.” See “Where Your Information Is Stored” below for information regarding where your Health Information is stored.


How We Collect Your Personal Information


We collect personal information from the following sources:


•
Directly. We collect personal information directly from you. When you register for the Services, submit information in an online form, request information from us, or otherwise communicate with us or our support personnel, you may provide us with information, for example, your name and email address.  We also collect Health Information about you by importing information from the Third-Party Applications (see above). By providing us with this information or allowing us access to the Third-Party Applications, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, processed and stored by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


•
From Third-Party Applications. We may collect Health Information about you by importing information from Third-Party Applications, if you permit us to do so. Imported Health Information is generally stored and processed on your device, except where you opt in to features (such as Bevel Intelligence) that require cloud processing. By providing us with this information or allowing us access to the Third-Party Applications, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, processed, and stored by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


Where Your Information Is Stored


•
Personal information and user-generated data. Contact information (such as name, email, phone, and profile data) and non-biometric user-generated data (such as logged workouts, diet, and activity history) are stored using secure third-party cloud hosting providers so that this information can sync across devices and support your use of the Services.


•
Health Information. Imported biometric Health Information (such as heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen, and respiratory rate) is, by default, stored and processed locally on your device. Unless you enable Bevel Intelligence, we do not store or access such imported biometric Health Information in the ordinary course of providing the Services.


•
Bevel Intelligence. If you enable the optional Bevel Intelligence feature, certain biometric Health Information (excluding reproductive health information unless you expressly opt in) may be transmitted through third-party cloud hosting and artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology providers in order to generate AI-powered responses and coaching. Only the minimum relevant information necessary to generate a response will be transmitted. Once such data is processed through those third-party providers, it is subject to their systems and safeguards.


To provide the Services, we store and process your personal data in the United States, where the Company is based. By using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand and consent to having any personal information transferred to and processed in the United States. If you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), we will transfer your personal information pursuant to EU data protection laws. You understand that the United States may not provide the same level of protections as the laws in your country. United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances law enforcement or regulatory agencies, courts or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.

Bevel Intelligence & Third-Party Artificial Intelligence Technology


When enabled, Bevel Intelligence processes Health Information you authorize us to access, including biometric information from Third-Party Applications. By default, reproductive health information is not transmitted to Bevel Intelligence; you may separately opt in if you wish the feature to use that data. Bevel Intelligence is a generative AI feature that is intended to help you understand and make progress to your goals, provide educational guidance, and integrate with the rest of your experience using our Services. To provide this feature, we leverage third-party cloud hosting providers and AI technology from our large language model partners. Your Health Information will be transmitted to, and processed by, these third parties solely for the purpose of generating responses and guidance.


We take the following steps to protect your privacy:


•
We only share Health Information in a format intended to minimize direct identifiability.


•
We may retain the history of your conversations with Bevel Intelligence so you can review past exchanges and so the feature can provide continuity and context in future interactions. Certain data used to generate conversations, which may include biometric or other sensitive information, may be retained for up to thirty (30) days for debugging and quality assurance purposes and is then deleted from our servers. After that period, only the conversation history itself remains available to you, unless you request its deletion. To access your information or request deletion, please contact us at hello@bevel.health.


Please note that Bevel Intelligence generates responses based on your inputs and Health Information, and those responses may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent. Bevel Intelligence does not provide medical advice and should never be relied upon as a substitute for professional medical care, diagnosis, or treatment. You should always consult a qualified physician or other licensed healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding your health, medical conditions, or wellness decisions.


We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information
